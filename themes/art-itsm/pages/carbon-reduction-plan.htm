                        <p class="lead">Operating as a virtual company with no physical offices, Alemba leverages remote work for both customer-facing services and internal administrative functions, significantly reducing its carbon footprint. Alemba has minimised emissions to as close to zero as possible, with only minimal carbon output on a very low volume of travel.</p>

                    </div>

                </div>

                <div class="row mb-5">

                    <div class="col-12">

                        <p>This innovative approach eliminates the need for daily commutes and the operation of office buildings, two major sources of carbon emissions. By conducting business digitally and utilising cloud-based technologies, Alemba not only enhances efficiency and flexibility but also demonstrates a strong commitment to environmental sustainability, aligning with global efforts to combat climate change.</p>

                        <p>Currently, Alemba mitigates our environmental impact through the following measures:</p>
 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Published content e.g. case studies, brochures etc. are available to be distributed electronically or can be downloaded via our website. Hard copies of our brochures are available when attending trade shows or attending site at our customers and prospects.</li>
                            <li>Alemba Service Manager is a browser-based application and requires a zero-client footprint and anyone with access to a web browser can access ASM if they have a valid login and permissions to do so.</li>
                            <li>The Alemba team from Support Desk, engineering through to Professional Services look to minimise mass document print production by sending its formal collateral electronically and will only store hard copies of material when the need permits e.g. NDA/Contracts.</li>
                            <li>Alemba has established a remote-first policy to reduce our carbon footprint and ensure the health and safety of our staff and clients. All Alemba staff work remotely, and face-to-face client engagements are kept to a minimum.</li>
                            <li>As a close-to net zero supplier, Alemba will not add to the carbon footprint of customers.</li>
                        </ul>
