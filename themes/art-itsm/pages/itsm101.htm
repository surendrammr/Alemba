               <p class="lead">IT Service Management (or ITSM) refers to all the processes and activities IT teams put in place to optimize the delivery of information technology (IT) services to customers. This includes the design, implementation, maintenance, and continual improvement of IT services throughout their lifecycles.</p>
               <p>ITSM is focused on driving maximum business value from information technologies and seeks to align IT processes and services with the overall needs of the business.</p>
               
               <h2>ITSM vs ITIL. What’s the difference?</h2>
               <p>There is often some confusion about the difference between ITSM and ITIL. These two terms are sometimes used interchangeably, when in fact they are not the same.</p>
               <p>While IT Service Management (ITSM) refers to all the processes an organization puts in place to manage and deliver IT services to its customers, ITIL (or The IT Infrastructure Library) is the framework or set of best practices that guides the delivery of IT services.</p>
               <p>ITIL is the most widely adopted standard in ITSM, but there are also other frameworks that align with IT Service Management. These include:</p>
               <ul>
                   <li><a href="https://www.isaca.org/resources/cobit">COBIT</a></li>
                   <li>Six Sigma</li>
                   <li><a href="https://apmg-international.com/product/fitsm">FitSM</a></li>
                   <li>ISO/IEC 20000</li>

                   <li>VeriSM</li>
               </ul>

               <h2>The Benefits of ITSM</h2>
               <p>There are many benefits of implementing ITSM processes in your organization, including:</p>
               <ul>
                   <li>Better alignment between IT and the business</li>
