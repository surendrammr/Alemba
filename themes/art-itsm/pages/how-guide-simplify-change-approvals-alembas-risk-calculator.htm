                <h2>Why Use the Change Risk Calculator?</h2>
                <p>Improve and automate your Change Advisory Board (CAB) by:</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 20px; text-indent: -20px;"><i class="fa fa-check me-2"></i>Consistent, Transparent Decisions – Remove guesswork with a standardized risk scoring model. </p>
                <p style="padding-left: 20px; text-indent: -20px;"><i class="fa fa-check me-2"></i>Faster Approvals – Automate risk assessment and focus CAB discussions on high-impact changes, ensuring mitigation plans are in place before implementation.</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 20px; text-indent: -20px;"><i class="fa fa-check me-2"></i>Automate Workflows – Route changes dynamically based on their risk level.</p>

                <h2>How the Change Risk Calculator Works</h2>
                <p>The risk calculator allows you to create a set of questions for each type of change that gather the important details defining the risk and assigning a numerical risk factor.</p> 
                <p>Risk factors can be defined for: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Change Complexity – Dependencies, integrations, and technical difficulty.</li>
                    <li>Business Impact – Effect on critical systems and operations.</li>
                    <li>Overall Risk Assessment – Categorized as Minor, Moderate, or Significant.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The calculator will then define an overall risk assessment, categorized as Minor, Moderate, or Significant.</p>

                <h2>Turn Risk Scores into Actionable Decisions</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Prioritize CAB Agendas – Focus discussions on the highest-risk changes.</li>
                    <li>Assess Mitigation Plans – Ensure safeguards are in place before approving high-risk changes.</li>
                    <li>Automate Workflows – Route changes dynamically based on their risk level.</li>
                </ul>
                -->

                <h2>The Benefits of Risk Scoring</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Planned Major System Upgrades – A consistent and scientific calculation of the priority and risk ensures risk factors are always assessed before major infrastructural changes.</li>
                    <li>Security Patches & Fixes – Based on technical assessment and testing, critical updates that are proven to be low-risk are fast-tracked.</li>
                    <li>Application Deployments – Risk factors such as system downtime and integration dependencies can be ranked.</li>
                    <li>Process Changes – When modifying business processes, consideration can be made for the dependencies on other processes and other factors such as resource availability avoiding unintended consequences.</li>
                    <li>Emergency Fixes – Streamline the assessment of risk factors allowing emergency changes to proceed quickly and safely.</li>
                </ul>
