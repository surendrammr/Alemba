                <h3>What is Alemba doing?</h3>

                <p>The Alemba wildcard SSL Certificate is due to expire on 7th September 2022 and Alemba have been working to deploy an updated certificate with minimal impact upon service.</p>
                <p>Alemba will be replacing the SSL Certificate on all systems to allow continued secure access to your Alemba Service Manager or vFire Alemba Cloud Hosted Systems.</p>
                <p>The SSL (Secure Socket Layer) certificate is a digital certificate that authenticates a website’s identity and enables an encrypted connection between the Web Server and the Browser (Using the HTTPS Protocol).</p>

                <img style="display:block;" src="{{ 'Emails/email-support-update-ssl-graphic.png'|media }}" alt="SSL certificate" />

                <h3>How does this affect Alemba Customers?</h3>

                <p>This affects all Alemba Customers using our Cloud Hosted/SAAS solution to access <em>Alemba Service Manager</em> (ASM) and <em>vFire Service Manager</em> (vFire).</p>

                <p>If you are hosting your ASM or vFire Application On-Premise or in your own Cloud Infrastructure, you <strong>should not</strong> be affected by this upcoming Alemba Cloud Service change.</p>

                <p>As part of applying the new SSL Certificate there will be a short outage whilst the Web Server is reset. This will vary on a system-by-system basis but should be between 30s and 3 minutes.</p>

                <h3>When will this take place?</h3>

                <p>Starting Monday 15th August 2022 until Friday 2nd September 2022 we will be rolling the certificate updates out to affected cloud systems.</p>

                <p>We will be updating your Test and Development Environments first and then updating Production Environments.</p>

                <p>We will be updating Production Environments outside of typical core working hours i.e. between <strong>7pm and 11pm</strong> local time.</p>

                <p>If you have any queries or questions, then please log a support call through the Alemba Support Portal <a href="https://alemba.help">https://alemba.help</a>.</p>
