               <p class="lead">With the rise in popularity of on-demand, accessible service delivery and the resulting change in customer expectations, businesses are pressed to rethink the ways they provide and consume services internally.</p>
               <p>IT Departments have long relied on Service Management principles such as ITIL to deliver better services and user experiences to their customers. Beyond IT, many business divisions have come to realise the benefits of adopting established <a href="{{ 'itsm101'|page }}">IT Service Management (ITSM)</a> best practice to drive value across the entire enterprise.</p>
               <p>By adopting an Enterprise Service Management (ESM) approach, as opposed to a more parochial IT Service Management focus, organisations can extend service management theories and principles into other core business functions.</p>

                <p>Enterprise Service Management is the application of ITSM principles to different service departments within an organisation with the goal of improving process efficiency and service delivery and promoting cross-departmental collaboration. Typically, service delivery departments such as HR, Facilities, Procurement and Finance are best positioned to benefit from the adoption of a holistic ESM approach.</p>
