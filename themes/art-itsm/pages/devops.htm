                <p class="lead">ASM’s Integration Hub brings together IT Service Management and modern development pipelines by providing a configurable bi-directional link to Microsoft Azure DevOps. Change requests raised in ASM are automatically synchronised to Azure DevOps as user stories, tasks or bugs, complete with priority, attachments and approval state. Conversely, code commits, pull-request IDs and pipeline statuses flow back into the change record in real time. This shared dataset eliminates manual re-keying and keeps service-desk agents, change managers and developers working from a single, authoritative source.</p>
                
               <p>Because the mapping rules are point-and-click rather than coded, organisations can align the interface with their existing governance model in hours, not weeks. Mandatory ITIL fields such as risk, impact and back-out plan remain owned in ASM, while agile attributes like story points reside in DevOps, ensuring each team sees only the elements that matter to them without breaking process continuity. Automated status transitions  e.g. promoting a change to “Ready for CAB” when the last build succeeds, tighten control while shortening lead times.</p>

               <p>Security and compliance are embedded throughout the integration so that DevSecOps goals and ISO 27001 clauses are met. All data is transferred over TLS 1.3 and authenticated with managed identities, preserving the confidentiality and integrity. Fine-grained role-based access controls in both platforms enforce segregation of duties, while every field update and code deployment is written to immutable audit trails. The unified view also accelerates incident response: service-desk staff can trace a production defect directly to the change record and developer who fulfilled it, enabling rapid containment and root-cause analysis that underpins continual improvement.</p>

               <p>In short, ASM’s Integration Hub turns change governance and software delivery into a single, secure workflow—letting teams ship faster without compromising control and quality.</p>
