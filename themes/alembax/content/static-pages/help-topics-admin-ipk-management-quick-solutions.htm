                                                    <p class="intro">You can define macros that automatically update details in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Call Details</span> window and optionally close the call. These "quick solutions" can be defined for commonly logged calls, such as a locked account or forgotten password, where the same details are required every time. Using Quick Solutions speeds up the process of logging common calls. </p>
                                                    <p>Analysts can select a quick solution by selecting the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Quick Solutions</span> explorer option on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Call Details</span> window, and selecting the required solutions from the displayed <span style="font-weight: bold;">Select Quick Solution</span> window. The Quick Solutions displayed will be the ones linked to the type they have chosen. If there are no Quick Solutions linked to the call’s issue type, all the Quick Solutions in the system will be displayed. You can define multiple Quick Solutions for a type.</p>
