                                                    <p>Quick Launch URLs are shortcuts that let you run a URL through the click of a link from a call, request or task. Parameters such as call fields, or even fields on a CMDB item linked to the call can be passed to a URL. This is useful, for example if you want to easily access a website.</p>
