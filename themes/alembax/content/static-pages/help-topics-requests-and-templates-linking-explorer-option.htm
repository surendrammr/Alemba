                                                    <p class="intro">The Linking Explorer option enables you to link calls or requests for change that relate to the request that is open. By using this linking function, you can easily access any related calls or requests from the Request Details interface rather than having to search for each call or request separately. </p>
                                                    <p> </p>
                                                    <p>There is no limit to the number of requests and calls which you can link to the current request, However, you must link each call and/or request one at a time. </p>
                                                    <p>You can link a request as either a parent or child of the current request, but you can only link calls as children to the current request. You can also link a request to another request that already has requests linked to it.</p>
