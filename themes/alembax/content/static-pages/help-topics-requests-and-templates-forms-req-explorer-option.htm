                                                    <p>The Forms Explorer option enables you to attach a form to the current request. Forms are specially designed to capture general, non-reportable, non-searchable information about a request. <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> is provided with a default (blank) form for requests. You can use the <a href="../designer/creating%20forms.htm"><span class="GeneralVariablesDesignerName">ASM Designer</span></a> to add fields to the default form or create new forms.</p>
