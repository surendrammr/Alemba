                                                    <h1>About the Service Window on a Request</h1>
                                                    <p>The Service Window is found in the lower half of the <b>Request Details</b> explorer pane. The Service Window displays agreements and active events for the current request. You can also view linked agreements through the <a href="slm%20request%20explorer%20option.htm">SLM</a> explorer option. </p>
                                                    <p>Requests can only have Organizational Level Agreements (OLAs) applied to them, therefore, you will only see OLA events within the Service Window on a task. </p>
                                                    <p class="note">If there is no agreement applied to the request, the Service Window displays a message to this effect. If there is an SLA applied to the request, the active SLM events for the SLA appear within the SLA section.</p>
                                                    <p> Once an event (such as, Action) is complete, it disappears from the window. If the task is complete, the Resolve event remains in the window.  </p>
                                                    <h2>Viewing the name of the linked agreement</h2>
                                                    <p>Hover your cursor over the name of the agreement type displayed in the SLM bar (that is, OLA or UC).</p>
                                                    <h2>Showing and hiding events for the linked agreement</h2>
                                                    <p>Click the SLM bar. Both active and inactive events configured for the agreement appear. Once an event is closed, it no longer appears. </p>
                                                    <p>The <b>escalation states</b> for the linked agreement are color-coded to indicate the level of escalation or breach. Escalation states also appear in the <b>Search</b>, <b>Outstanding</b>, and <b>Workload</b> windows.</p>
                                                    <h2>Stopping and starting the clock on an agreement</h2>
                                                    <p>Once an agreement is attached to a task, it begins running against a ‘clock’. <span class="GeneralVariablesProductName">ASM</span> continually monitors the amount of time the agreement has been in effect and checks if any events are scheduled to occur. An agreement may trigger a number of events such as different types and levels of escalations, and breach. If you have sufficient permissions, you can stop and restart the clock on a particular agreement. This may be required, for instance, if you are waiting on further information from a customer and cannot proceed with the task until you get this information. While the clock is stopped, no time will accumulate on the agreement and no escalation or agreement breach events will occur. </p>

This dialog box will be displayed only if your administrator has enabled <b>reasons</b> in system administration. </li>
