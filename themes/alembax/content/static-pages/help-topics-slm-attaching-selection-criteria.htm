<a name="top"></a>Attaching Selection Criteria to Agreements</h1>
                                                    <p>Agreements have selection criteria attached to them. These are rules which tell <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> when to apply the agreement. Agreements are selected and applied to calls, requests, and tasks based on the IPK and Workflow selection criteria, respectively. Updates to call or request details may trigger a new agreement to be applied to the call/request, if these details affect the selection criteria. </p>
                                                    <p>Your administrator defines the criteria you can select through the Agreement Selection Priority window. When evaluating the selection criteria, <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> also checks the CMDB Selection Priority to identify which CMDB item to use if multiple CMDB items are linked to the call, request, or task.</p>
                                                    <p class="note">If you apply an agreement to a call, request, or task manually, changing the details will not automatically select and apply a different agreement. If a new agreement is applicable in this case, it has to be applied to the call, request, or task manually. </p>
                                                    <p class="exampletext">You set up a certain User against an SLA as selection criteria. If a call is logged from that User, <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> will automatically locate that agreement and apply it to the call depending on other agreement selection criteria configured.</p>
                                                    <p class="exampletext">If you link a User J Smith and a config item of Main Server as selection criteria, then any calls from J Smith or with the config item Main Server will automatically pick up this agreement.</p>
                                                    <h2>Adding SLA Selection Criteria</h2>
                                                    <p>You can apply a wide variety of IPK or Workflow selection criteria to an SLA. IPK selection criteria are used while selecting an agreement to apply to a call, and Workflow selection criteria are used while selecting an agreement to apply to a request.</p>
                                                    <p class="note">When the IPK Status of a call is changed, the SLA linked to the call will continue to be applied and events will be calculated until the Service Resumed button on the Service Window in the Call Details Explorer panel is clicked. This button will close all events for all agreements linked to the call.</p>
