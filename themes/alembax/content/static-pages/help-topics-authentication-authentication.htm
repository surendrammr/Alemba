                                                    <p>Authentication is designed to ensure that only authorized people can access the system via credentials provided at login. Authorization is the process by which users' access and actions are restricted within the system, based on their login details.</p>
                                                    <p><b>Single Sign On</b> allows users to access multiple applications without the need for multiple passwords. </p>
                                                    <p>You can find out more about the different uses and applications of Integrated Security and Single Sign On in <a href="integrated%20security%20v%20single%20sign%20on.htm" class="MCXref xref">Integrated Security v Single Sign On</a>.</p>

                                                    <h2>Single Sign On Using SAML</h2>
                                                    <p>SAML is an identity federation standard language that enables SSO to access web applications with enhanced security. It limits potential risks by eliminating the need for extra web application passwords by establishing a trust between the <span class="GeneralVariablesAppName">ASM app</span> and the Organization's Federated Identity system(s).</p>
                                                    <p>You can find out more about configuring and using SSO with SAML in <a href="../sso%20technical%20reference%20guide/about%20sso.htm" class="MCXref xref">Single Sign-On using SAML</a>.</p>
