                                                    <p class="intro">Security profiles control Analysts’ access to objects, actions and solutions, notes, emails, letters, CMDB items and timesheet entries for different entities in <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span>, such as calls, requests and tasks. When adding information by one of these means (for example, through a note on a call), Analysts can apply a security profile to the additional information. Only those Analysts who have access to the selected security profile are then able to view the information.</p>
                                                    <p>Analysts are allocated access to security profiles through their <a href="%7B%7B%20'help-managing-people-managing-people#Completing_Person_Details'%7CstaticPage%20%7D%7D#Completing_Person_Details">Person Details</a>. If an Analyst does not have a security profile, they will not have access to the object, action and solution, note, email, letter, CMDB item or timesheet entry to which that profile is applied. </p>
                                                    <p class="note">Any system-generated history entries for a call, request or task will use an ‘Unspecified’ security profile. Similarly, any objects added through a call logged via incoming email will also use an ‘Unspecified’ security profile.</p>
