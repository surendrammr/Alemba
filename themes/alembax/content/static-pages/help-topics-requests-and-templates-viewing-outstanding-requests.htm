The <b>Physical Status</b> column indicates the action that is expected to be taken on the request. Taking action on a request does not remove its suspended status. To manually remove suspension on a request, use the <img src="/storage/app/media/Help/images/reset%20suspension%20button.png"> button on the toolbar.</p>
