                                            <p>Self Diagnosis enables you to use scripts to assist you with identifying solutions for common issues. </p>
                                            <p>Scripting enables the guided resolution of potentially complex, or simply recurring problems. Users select a predefined Problem category and are led step-by-step through a series of questions and answers.</p>
                                            <p>Files such as documents and diagrams can be attached to specific parts of the script to better enable users to solve their Problem.</p>
                                            <p>A script consists of a sequence of questions about your particular issue. It takes you through the sequence based on the answer you selected for each question. At the end of each question, you receive advice on how to deal with that particular stage of the process. The aim of the scripts is to assist you in resolving the Problem. Scripts are set up by your system administrator. </p>
                                            <p class="prereq">You must have <b>Scripts</b> selected in the <a href="../topics/adminselfserviceportal/cp%20role%20-%20options%20tab.htm">Options</a> tab of your <b><span class="GeneralVariablesSelfServicePortalName">Self Service Portal</span> Role</b> to access this option.</p>

                                                <li value="1">On the <b>My Options</b> menu, select <b>Self Help</b> &gt; <b>Self Diagnosis</b>.</li>
                                                <li value="2">The <b>Self Diagnosis Scripts</b> page appears. Select your script from the drop-down list.</li>
                                                <li value="3">Click <b>OK</b>. A list of questions and corresponding responses for the selected script are displayed.  </li>

The AND/OR field enables you to add additional information to your response. You can provide either a clarification to listed response you have chosen, or define a "different" option if none of the listed options fits your response. In each case, the text specified in the AND/OR field becomes part of the accumulated script dialog that can be passed on to any call logged from the script.</p>
