                                                    <p>You can save the call periodically to save any information that you have entered on the call, while still keeping the Call Details window open. This is useful when you are working on a call over a period of time, to periodically save the information you have entered so that it does not get lost, for example, in the event of a power failure. It also lets you store the details of the call but put off any action on the call (that is, forward internally, externally, or defer) for a later date or time. </p>
                                                    <p>Scroll to the bottom of the <b>Call Details</b> window if necessary, and select <b>Save</b>. Alternatively, select the Save explorer option. The <b>Call Details</b> window will remain open. </p>

                                                        <concept term="IPK"></concept>If you have IPK Rules configured on your system, they will not be run when you save the call. They will run only when the call is deferred or forwarded.</p>
                                                    <p>Saving a call (unlike when you forward internally, externally or defer) is not considered to be an action.

                                                    <p class="warning">If you are using Service Level Management on your system, saving a call may result in an agreement being applied to the call. The details of agreements applied to a call appear in the Service Window.</p>
