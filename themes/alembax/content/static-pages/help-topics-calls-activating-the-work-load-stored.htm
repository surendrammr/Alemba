                                                    <p>The Work Load option activates the Work Load stored procedure. This automatically repopulates the analyst/group list so as to show the calls that the analysts and groups currently have open. This enables analysts forwarding a call to quickly see which analysts and groups have a large amount of work, so they can make better decisions about to whom the call should be forwarded. </p>
