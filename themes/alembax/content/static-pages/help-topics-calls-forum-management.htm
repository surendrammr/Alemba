                                                    <p>Forums are a special type of group that is created when a call of a certain problem type is logged. Analysts in the forum can view the call from their <b>Calls Outstanding</b> window by choosing the <a href="forum%20analysts%20explorer%20option.htm"><b>Forum</b> explorer option</a>. Forum members do not own the calls in their forum, but can review them and add comments. <span class="GeneralVariablesProductName">ASM</span> enables you to configure Forum Workflows and apply them based on call attributes.</p>
                                                    <p>The forum management windows enable you to create and administer call forums in <span class="GeneralVariablesProductName">ASM</span>.  You can also define roles for forum members, and statuses that describe the relationship between the forum member and the call. </p>
