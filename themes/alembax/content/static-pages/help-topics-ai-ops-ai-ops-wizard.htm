                                                    <p>This optional step allows you to run the analysis for each member of a “group” (that is, all the items you add to the grouping criteria). Using grouping criteria means that an AI Ops rule will trigger a call or request if the threshold in the rule is met for any of the “members” in this group. </p>
                                                    <p>If you use a multi-select list as a Grouping Criteria, the rule will group the analysis by any item in the list. For example if the threshold for the rule is 10 calls, and you add a User multi-select list as the grouping criteria, then, a new call/event may be triggered if the threshold in the rule is reached for any User in the list.</p>

                                                        <br>The Problem Manager configures an automated AI Ops rule to log a call whenever more than 5 high priority outage calls are logged against critical servers. She applies a Grouping Criteria = CI. This means that the rule will log a new call if 5 high priority outage calls are logged against any critical server within the group, and also allows multiple calls to be logged within each run of the rule (per group item if applicable). If the Problem Manager had not applied the Grouping Criteria, then the rule would log a call if more than 5 high priority outage calls were logged against the whole group of critical servers. |end|</p>
