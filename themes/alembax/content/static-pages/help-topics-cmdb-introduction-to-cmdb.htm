                                                    <p>The quality of data within the CMDB affects the efficiency of IT service management and  corporate service management. <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> provides a wide range of features to help you manage your CMDB, from creating CMDB records to linking CMDB entities, freezing configuration items and services and searching for CMDB records.</p>
                                                    <p><span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span>'s CMDB includes service level agreements, <span class="GeneralVariablesServiceRequestCatalog">Service Request Catalog</span>s, warranties and knowledge. It offers a comprehensive system for applying ITIL service asset and configuration management (SACM) processes, as it integrates with Incident or Problem management (IPK), Workflow Management and Service Level Management (SLM) and enables the enterprise to manage evolving relationships of items with people, internal departments and locations, other organizations and external suppliers. </p>
                                                    <p>It can also integrate with several third-party hardware and software discovery tools such as  Service Assurance Manager to detect external resources on these applications. The resources can then be imported into <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> as new CMDB items or be linked to existing CMDB records.</p>

One recommended usage is to create CMDB Items template based on these (vCloud) types and to use these templates when setting up Federated CMDB integration with vCloud Director.</td>

                                                    <p>Analysts can create individual CMDB records for each of the entity types described above, and link them as appropriate. For example, you can use the Person entity type to create records for your Users and the Organization entity type to create records for the organizations or departments to which your Users belong, and then link these records together to reflect the relationships between Users and organizations.</p>
                                                    <p>The system administrator can also define Configuration Item, Service, Service Action and Service Bundle sub types. For example, the administrator may define CI sub types such as Hardware and Software, or Service sub types such as Email, Internet and Virus Protection. Under Hardware, the administrator may also create Hardware sub types such as Server, Printer and Router, and so on. Analysts can then create individual records using these sub types. For example, you can use the Printer sub type to create records for each of the printers used in your organization. </p>
                                                    <p>Sub types inherit the properties of the parent type and can be associated with a specific screen set configured through <span class="GeneralVariablesDesignerName">ASM Designer</span> to capture only the details relevant to that CMDB item type. This ability to create a multi-tiered structure enables organizations with a large number of configuration items and services to classify their assets and use specially configured details screens for each CI and service type. This grants organizations the ability to tailor the CMDB to meet their exact requirements.</p>
