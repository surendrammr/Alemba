                                                    <p>Requests are created when change is required, for example when you must implement a workaround to resolve a call logged at the Service Desk. When a request is created, the appropriate template, including predefined attributes and a dependency diagram linking all tasks and approvals, must be selected. </p>
                                                    <p>The main steps in managing a request are as follows:</p>
                                                    <ol>
                                                        <li value="1">
<a href="create%20a%20request.htm">Create the request</a>, using the appropriate workflow template.</li>
                                                        <li value="2">
<a href="../tasks/creating%20a%20task.htm">Create the tasks and approvals</a>  that need to be completed for the request and forward those that require manual completion to the appropriate analysts.</li>
                                                        <li value="3">If tasks and approvals have been suspended, <a href="authorization%20explorer%20option.htm">authorize the tasks and approvals</a> to release them for action.</li>
                                                        <p class="note">
                                                            </p>
<p>Tasks and approvals are automatically created as suspended when you are creating a request. You will need to authorize each task and approval to release them. Your system may be configured to automatically authorize all tasks on taking action on (saving, deferring, or forwarding) the request, or through the Authorization window.</p>

<a href="actioning%20a%20request.htm">Action the request</a>. You can save a request at any stage and add more details later if required.</li>
                                                        <li value="5">
