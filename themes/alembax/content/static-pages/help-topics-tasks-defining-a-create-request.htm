                                                    <h1>Defining a Create Request Task</h1>
                                                    <p>As a workflow progresses, there may be situations where another change is required. This change could be handled within the same workflow, unless it is in a field of responsibility of another team or analyst, or it is a distinct business process in itself (for example, a change request initiating a release request).</p>
                                                    <p>Create Request Tasks give you more control of the assignment of workflows, and allow you to break large and complex workflows into smaller, more manageable segments. They can be used to generate requests when this type of task is completed, or as part of a workflow. They are manual by default, but they can be automatic. </p>
                                                    <p>The Create Request task will automatically generate another change request based on a workflow template. This new request is linked to the original as its child and can be viewed in the linking diagram. Once created, the new and the original requests run independently. When the new (child) request is closed, this is indicated in the linking diagram. This will not be indicated in the history of the original (parent) request.</p>
                                                    <p>The Create Request task allows for any request field to be mapped as a static value or a value from the existing request.</p>
                                                    <p class="warning">You should not define <b>Create Request</b> tasks directly after the <b>Request Start</b> task in a workflow, or after another task that in turn has a Create Request task. This may result in infinite recursions, creating a request that creates a task that in turn creates a request and so on.</p>
