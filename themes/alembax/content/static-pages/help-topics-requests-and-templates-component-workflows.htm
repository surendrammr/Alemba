                                                    <p>There are processes within your organization that need to be performed on a regular basis, or are fairly generic and can be used organization-wide. These ‘sub-processes’ are often included within other processes, such as purchase order requests, training requests, and updates to a human resource system.</p>
                                                    <p><b>Component Workflows</b> are re-usable templates that can be used for these sub-processes. It is then a simple matter to drag and drop the component into the workflow template.</p>
                                                    <p>Using Component Workflows offers considerable time savings, specifically:</p>

                                                    </ul>
                                                    <p class="note">Workflow components can be inserted into templates or into other components, but not directly in a request. The tasks in a component are automatically expanded in the request dependency diagram. </p>
