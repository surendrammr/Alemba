                                                    <p><b>Finding a call</b> involves using the Search or Outstanding windows, or by typing the call number into the Quick Search.</p>
                                                    <p><b>Updating a call</b> can involve changing values in fields, such as the Priority or Service, adding comments, changing the status, or assigning to an analyst or group, and finally saving the changes.</p>
                                                    <p><b>Closing a call</b> involves changing the value in the <b>Status</b> field to a status configured with the Close function by the System Administrator, and saving the call.</p>

<p class="exampletext">If a large network is undergoing an upgrade and is thus slower than normal, then there will be a high impact (that is, everyone on the network is affected) but a low priority (nobody is seriously affected by the issue).

<p>If your administrator has configured your system to use a formula to automatically derive the priority from impact and urgency, the <b>Priority</b> field will be disabled. You must complete the <b>Urgency</b> and <b>Impact</b> fields before the call priority can be calculated automatically. If your system is not configured for the priority calculation, simply select the appropriate priority from the Priority list.</p>If a priority has been deleted by your administrator, it will be flagged with an asterisk. You should notify your administrator in this case so that they can configure the priority matrix to pick an active priority for the selected impact and urgency combination.<p class="note">All changes to Priority are automatically recorded in the call history.</p>
