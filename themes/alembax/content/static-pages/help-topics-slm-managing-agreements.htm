                                                    <p><b>Service Level Management (SLM)</b> covers advanced management of various agreements or service commitments that businesses can enter into. A service commitment refers to the speed and quality of service the user expects and the provider is able to provide. Failure to meet an agreed service commitment is called a breach. The expectations of all stakeholders can be formalized and documented in the form of an agreement.</p>
                                                    <p>SLM in <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> covers three different types of agreements: </p>

<b>Service Level Agreements (SLAs)</b> are agreements between a service provider and its Users. SLAs are applicable to both calls and requests. For example, you might have an agreement with your Users to respond to and fix PC service calls within a set timeframe. They can be driven off Service Levels, or configured to be applied based on individual Users, config items, organizations, locations, or types.</li>
                                                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;" value="2">
<b>Operational Level Agreements (OLAs)</b> are agreements between internal departments of a service provider. OLAs are applicable to calls, tasks, and approvals. For example, you might have an agreement that states that Third Level Support will resolve technical issues sent to them from the service desk within a certain amount of time. </li>
                                                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;" value="3">
<b>Underpinning Contracts (UCs)</b> are agreements between a service provider and the external suppliers who provide additional services or support to the service provider. UCs are applicable to calls, tasks, and approvals. For example, you might have an agreement with a hardware supplier that they will deliver computers or parts within a certain number of days from when they are ordered. </li>

                                                            <p class="exampletext">The following example illustrates how time zones interact with <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span>’s Service Level Management system to provide global support for service commitments.
<br><br>TechCorp has offices in three locations: London, Sydney and Seattle. The base of operations including the <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> server is in Seattle, though their IT service desk is based in Sydney. The server time zone for Pacific USA (Seattle) is GMT -8:00, London office is GMT 0:00 and Sydney office (and all their support staff) are in GMT +10:00.
One of their staff is working in London and at midnight he attempts to access the company website, which is hosted in Seattle; he discovers that the web server has gone down and the website cannot be accessed.
<br><br>He logs a call to the service desk in Sydney (where it is currently 10:00 am); the configuration item is identified as being a web server in Seattle, and <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> picks up and applies the Seattle Support Agreement. This agreement is in the Pacific USA time zone (where it is currently 4:00 pm), and has a set of working hours that specify that support is offered from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm, seven days a week.
<br><br>The agreement specifies that Resolve escalation will occur two hours after the call is logged, and the agreement will be broken (that is, Resolve breach will occur) four hours after the call is logged. However, those times are based on the time zone and working hours for the Seattle Support Agreement, not for where the call was logged from (London) or logged to (Sydney).
<br><br>It is currently 4:00 pm in Seattle, and with a 9:00 am to 5:00 pm set of working hours, escalation will occur at 10:00 am the next day Seattle time; one hour from 4:00 till 5:00 pm, then when work hours begin the next day at 9:00 am, the second hour (and thus resolve escalation) is at 10:00 am. The agreement will be broken if the call is not resolved two hours after that, that is, midday.
<br><br>The resolve escalation and resolve breach will occur at 10:00 am and midday Seattle time, and are converted to any local analyst’s time zone, if they have one defined. The analyst in Sydney forwards it to a senior technician (also in Sydney), who opens the call and looks at the Call SLA window to check the status of the call in terms of its agreements. <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> shows him that resolve escalation and breach will occur at 2:00 am and 4:00 am the next day respectively; these are the Seattle times converted to local (that is, Sydney) time zone.
<br><br>In London, the staff member can expect the Resolve Escalation by 6:00 pm and Resolve Breach at 8:00 pm.

                                                    <p>If you are applying agreements based on User and you have some Users in time zone A and some in time zone B, you should create two agreements, one for each time zone. This will ensure that <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> performs the right calculations for escalation and breach times based on the User’s expectations in their actual time zone, not the time zone where the call is being actioned.
