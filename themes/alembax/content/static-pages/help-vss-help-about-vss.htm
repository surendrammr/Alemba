                                            <p>You can drill down from the summary widgets on the home page to interrogate your incidents, requests, approvals and resources, and scroll down to view more summary information.</p>

                                            <p>The information displayed on the portal depends on the user login - their permissions and partition access - and the information held in the CMDB regarding the resource. Some resources are not visible in the portal, and this is determined by the system administrator, or whoever is responsible for maintaining the CMDB Item details. Likewise, some information is restricted to specific stakeholders or subscribers.</p>
