                                                    <p class="intro">A transaction transfers licenses or inventory items to and from various “transaction pools”. For instance you might have 25 licenses for a software product, Microsoft Word, in the On Hand pool and 60 in the In Use pool, meaning that you have 25 available to allocate, and 60 already allocated. After each transaction, <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> automatically recalculates the levels in each pool (that is the quantity of items). Transactions can also be automated through requests.</p>
                                                    <p><a name="aanchor42"></a>
                                                        <concept term="CMDB"></concept><span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> enables you to perform various transactions on inventory items and software products, such as ordering items, adding them to your CMDB once the order has been received, purchasing items (making them immediately available in the CMDB rather than ‘on order’ as is the case for an order transaction), reserving them for certain Users, or retiring items.</p>
                                                    <p>It is possible to perform many different types of transactions in order to manage assets. You can add transactions manually through the Transaction Details window on a software product or inventory. Transactions can also be created automatically through the <b class="Xref_outstanding">Manage CMDB Task</b> in the workflow palette. You can also allocate or reserve licenses and inventory items from a call, request or task.</p>
                                                    <p>An example of bulk inventory tracking would be if, say, configuration manager is told that there is a new office opening for 50 new employees in North Sydney. The configuration manager needs to order new configuration items for the office such as computers, printers, keyboards, computer mice, and telephones. Because of the large number of peripheral items such as keyboards, it makes sense to manage them as a single Inventory, Keyboards – North Sydney Office, rather than 50 separate keyboard records. The configuration manager:</p>
