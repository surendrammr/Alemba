                                                    <p class="intro">You can configure your system for managing your service desk operation, setting global options for the Service Desk, as well as defining values for the parameters used on call windows. </p>
                                                    <h2>IPK Tiers</h2>
                                                    <p>The IPK management functionality encompasses ITIL guidelines for Incident Problem Known Error (IPK) Management.  According to these guidelines, a three-tiered approach is recommended for managing incidents, the tiers being Incidents, Problems, and Known Errors also referred to as IPK.</p>
                                                    <p>To understand this system better, you should have an understanding of the tiers.</p>

<b>Incidents</b> are call records where a fault (about a service) is reported by a User is logged. The objective is to get the User’s issue resolved.</li>
                                                        <li value="2">When a number of Incidents pertaining to the same service is logged, one of them is promoted to a <b>Major Incident</b>. A Major Incident occurs when the impact of a fault affects a number of Users.</li>
                                                        <li value="3">
<b>Problems</b> are logged when they require an investigation to determine the cause of an Incident. The objective is to get the service operational.</li>
                                                        <li value="4">When the cause is identified and a <b>Request for Change</b> is initiated to rectify the issue if appropriate, a Problem record can be converted to or cloned to a <b>Known Error</b>.</li>
                                                    </ol>
                                                    <p>Using this concept, when an Analyst logs a new Incident, the Incident is matched against existing Incidents, Problems, and Known Errors. Available workarounds are applied to ensure that the Incident is resolved quickly. The benefits that this approach provides include an improvement in the quality of service provided by the service desk, a reduction in the turnaround time in providing a resolution, and subsequently reducing the volume of Incidents logged.</p>
