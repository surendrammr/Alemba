                                                    <p>When Analysts log a call in <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span>, they can select the IPK status and a corresponding stream for the call. For example, if you create two IPK streams, Software, and ‘Standard’, and link both streams to the IPK status, Incident, when an analyst logs a call as an Incident, they will be able to select either  Software or Standard as the stream. </p>
                                                    <p>The purpose of defining streams and linking them to statuses is the following:</p>

                                                        <li value="2">to simplify the call logging process by allowing you to configure your call logging screen based on an IPK status/stream/type combination</li>
                                                        <li value="3">to allow you to restrict access to the streams to which an Analyst has access through their <a href="../admin%20security%20roles/security%20roles.htm">IPK security role</a>
