                                                    <p>A <b>transaction</b> is simply a way of designating how a particular quantity of licenses/items is being used in the CMDB. It is an action you can perform on a Software Product or Inventory CMDB item, such as a new order or new purchase, allocation, or reservation of a quantity of licenses/items. Transactions can also be automated through requests.</p>
                                                    <p>A transaction transfers licenses/items to and from various “transaction pools”. For instance you might have 25 licenses for a software product, Microsoft Word, in the On Hand pool and 60 in the In Use pool, meaning that you have 25 available to allocate to users, and 60 already allocated. After each transaction, <span class="GeneralVariablesProductName">ASM</span> automatically recalculates the levels in each pool (that is the quantity of items). </p>
                                                    <p>The <b>Transactions</b> Explorer option enables you to initiate Asset Management transactions from the current task/call. Asset Management transactions include receiving, updating and deleting asset orders, and allocating assets to people and/or CMDB items.</p>

<b>Purchases</b> allows you to manage the purchases added to the task for software products or inventory items you have received or purchased. The state of these items can change, that is they can be in use or reserved.

This view has two browse tables. The top browse table is the list of purchases, and has columns for all the purchase transaction details. The bottom browse table has two tabs or views, <b>In Use</b> and <b>Reserved</b>. Each view represents the state of the purchased items after a particular transaction was performed. Note that a blank value in a column means that this transaction detail was intentionally left unspecified or it is not relevant to the particular transaction. Click <b>Filter Columns</b> to show or hide columns in the browse table. If there are orders, the <b>Update</b>, <b>Receive Order</b>, and <b>Delete</b>  buttons are enabled.</li>

You can add multiple purchases of an item. A record is created for each purchase you add. Clear this option to list the items in all purchases.
