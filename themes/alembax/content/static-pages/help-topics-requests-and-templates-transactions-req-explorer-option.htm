                                                    <h1>Transactions Req Explorer Option</h1>
                                                    <p>The Transactions explorer option enables you to view or perform transactions on a software product or inventory item from the <b>Request Details</b> window. 
</p>
                                                    <p>A transaction is simply a way of designating how a particular quantity of licenses/items is being used in the CMDB; an action you can perform on a Software Product or Inventory CMDB item, such as a new order or new purchase, allocation, or reservation of a quantity of software licenses or inventory items to transfer software licenses or inventory items to and from various “transaction pools”. </p>
                                                    <p>For instance you might have 25 licenses for a software product, Microsoft Word, in the On Hand pool and 60 in the In Use pool, meaning that you have 25 available to allocate to users, and 60 already allocated. </p>
                                                    <p>After each transaction, <span class="GeneralVariablesProductName">ASM</span> automatically recalculates the levels in each pool (that is the quantity of items).</p>
                                                    <p>Transactions can also be automated through requests.
</p>
                                                    <ol>
                                                        <li value="1">Select the <b>Take Action</b> button on the <b>Request Details</b> window if necessary to allow you to work on the request.</li>
                                                        <li value="2">In the Explorer pane, expand <b>Data</b>, then select <b>Transactions</b>. The Transactions window has two tabs:<ul>
<li value="1">
<b>Orders</b> allows you to manage the orders added to the request for software product or inventory items you have ordered but have not yet received</li>
<li value="2">
<b>Purchases</b> allows you to manage the purchases added to the request for software products or inventory items you have received or purchased. The state of these items can change, that is they can be in use or reserved. Each state (also referred to as a “transaction pool”) is represented by the tabs or views in the Purchases view (<b>In Use</b> and <b>Reserved</b>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
                                                        <li value="3">Select the <b>Orders</b> tab if necessary to view a list of order records for a software product or inventory that were added to the current request.
The browse table  has columns for all the order transaction details. <ul>
<li value="1">A blank value in a column means that this transaction detail was intentionally left unspecified or it is not relevant to the particular transaction. Click Filter Columns to show or hide columns.
</li>
<li value="2">Select <b>Display Incomplete Orders only</b> to only show orders which are not yet complete, that is, orders for which you have only received some of the items in the order. Clear the option to show both complete and incomplete orders. You can add multiple orders of an item. A record is created for each order you add. If there are multiple orders, <span class="GeneralVariablesProductName">ASM</span> automatically calculates the total quantity of items in all the orders to display in the <b>Item Summary</b>.
</li>
<li value="3">If there are orders, the <b>Update</b>, <b>Receive Order</b> and <b>Delete</b> buttons are enabled.</li>
</ul>

This view has two browse tables. The top browse table is the list of purchases, and has columns for all the purchase transaction details.

</li>
<li value="3">If there are purchases, the <b>Update</b> and <b>Delete</b> buttons are enabled. This enables action buttons below the relevant views, <b>In Use</b> and <b>Reserved</b>. The buttons provide specific actions you can perform on the items in the selected purchase pool. </li>
