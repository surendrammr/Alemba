                                                    <p class="intro">When you are first added to the system, your system administrator will give you your login ID and password. Your login ID cannot be changed but you should change your password regularly, adhering to standard password security protocol.</p>
                                                    <p>You may find that the system is set up so that passwords expire after a certain period. If your password expires without your knowledge - if, say, you are on leave - you will be prompted to create a new one when you next log in to <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span>.</p>
