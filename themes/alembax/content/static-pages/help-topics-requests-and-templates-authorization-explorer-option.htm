                                                    <p>The Authorization Explorer option enables you to authorize the current request so it can start being implemented. Authorizing a request releases all tasks and approvals in the request. </p>
                                                    <p>You can pre-authorize requests by authorizing the workflow template. By default (unless configured differently by the system administrator), tasks and approvals are not authorized when first created. </p>

The Authorize button will be enabled if there are any unauthorized tasks.</p>
