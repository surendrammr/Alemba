<p>Each selected screen, form, or message template appears in its own tab within the <span class="GeneralVariablesDesignerName">ASM Designer</span> window.

If the screen belongs to the default screen set for an entity, the name of the tab is [entity name] [screen name], for example, Agreement Agreement Details. When you open a portal  screen, such as Call Submission, two blank columns are displayed on the right. <a class="MCPopupThumbnailLink MCPopupThumbnailPopup" href="../../resources/images/designer%20customer%20portal%20screen.png"><img class="MCPopupThumbnail img imgthumbnail" data-mc-width="1078" data-mc-height="857" src="/storage/app/media/Help/images/designer%20customer%20portal%20screen_thumb_0_48.png" tabindex=""></a> You can configure the screen by inserting fields into these columns.
