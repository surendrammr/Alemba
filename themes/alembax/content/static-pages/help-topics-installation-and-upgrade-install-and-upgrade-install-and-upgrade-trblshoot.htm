                                                    <p class="question">Why are some <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> files left on the server when I uninstall <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span>?</p>
                                                    <p class="answer">During uninstall, if any <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> files are open or in use, those files cannot uninstall because of Microsoft Explorer’s restrictions. Before you uninstall <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span>, ensure that no <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> files are in use or open. Files are found here by default: <b>C:\Program Files\<span class="GeneralVariablesCompanyName3">Alemba</span>\<span class="GeneralVariablesProductName">ASM</span></b>.</p>
                                                    <p class="question">I am getting error messages when I run Chat.</p>
                                                    <p class="answer">One of the most common reasons for error messages and Chat working incorrectly is incorrect configuration of your virtual directory. Ensure that your system is pointing to the correct virtual directory and, if you have several systems, that they are each pointing to their own.</p>
                                                    <p class="question">My Chat analysts are not showing as online.</p>
                                                    <p class="answer">Ensure that your system is pointing to the correct virtual directory.</p>
                                                    <p class="question">Should <span class="GeneralVariablesProductName">ASM</span> be added to the antivirus exclusion list?</p>
                                                    <p class="answer">Yes, exclude the <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> virtual directory and install location from antivirus scans and real-time monitoring.</p>

                                                    <p class="question">Files are not attaching to emails, or I am receiving errors regarding the size of file attachments.</p>
                                                    <p class="answer">The maximum size of an attachment is set in several places. If it is less than 2GB, it can be set in the <b>System Settings</b> window in Admin. If it is larger than that, it must be set in the web.config and the IIS. </p>
                                                    <p class="question">I cannot find the "Forgotten Password" settings.</p>
                                                    <p class="answer1">The <b>Forgot Password</b> settings were maintained in the <b>Self Service Settings</b> window prior to this release. These are now managed in <b>Designer</b> by configuring the "Click here for Password Reminder" label in the <b>Portal Screens Login</b> screen.</p>

                                                    <p class="question">My application pool settings appear differently to the ones displayed in the Installation documentation.</p>
                                                    <p class="answer1">The <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> installer creates a Web Application and corresponding Application Pool for the <span class="GeneralVariablesCompanyName2">Alemba®</span>.Web and <span class="GeneralVariablesCompanyName2">Alemba®</span>.API web services.</p>
                                                    <p class="answermid">If the a Web Application is already configured for the installation directory, the installer will use that Web Application and the corresponding Application Pool.</p>
                                                    <p class="answermid">The installer will override settings for .Net CLR Version, Enabled 32-Bit Applications, Managed Pipeline Mode, Start Mode and Idle Timeout. These settings are applied to whichever application pool is linked to the <span class="GeneralVariablesCompanyName2">Alemba®</span>.API and <span class="GeneralVariablesCompanyName2">Alemba®</span>.Web Web Applications.</p>
                                                    <p class="answermid">These Web Applications should be configured with dedicated Application Pools, per the default configuration.</p>
