                                                    <p>A script takes the form of a question (or prompt) and various responses (options). Each option has detailed advice and may also have a question that leads to another level of options beneath it. You should ask the user the question and then select the option that corresponds to their answer. </p>
                                                    <p>Whenever Scripting is configured, a check is made after the issue <b>type</b> is selected on the <b>Call Details</b> window to see whether a script is available for that Type. </p>
                                                    <p>As you navigate through the 3-tiered problem type structure, if there is a script available for a specific type, the Script explorer option will turn red. </p>
                                                    <p>Therefore, as you browse through the Type hierarchy you can see immediately whether or not there is a script available for a specific type. </p>
                                                    <p class="prereq">The <b>Script</b> explorer option is only enabled if the scripting is configured in the <a href="../admin%20ipk%20management/ipk%20settings.htm" name="aanchor325">IPK Settings</a> window. </p>
                                                    <ol>
                                                        <li value="1">Display the <b>Call Details</b> window, if it is not already on screen.</li>
                                                        <li value="2">In the explorer pane, expand <b>Resolutions</b>, then select <b>Script</b>.</li>
                                                        <p class="note">While the <b>Call Script</b> window is open, you can switch back to the <b>Call Details</b> window, simply by moving the cursor across and clicking on any part of the inactive window. You will probably need to drag the <b>Call Script</b> window off to one side while it is still active, to view the <b>Call Details</b> window. </p>
                                                        <li value="3">In the <b>Call Script</b> window, at <b>Script</b> select the required script. Only those scripts that are linked to the issue type of the current call are displayed in this list. </li>
                                                        <p class="tip">The appropriate script should be displayed automatically, otherwise check each one from the <b>Script</b> dropdown list until you find one that looks likely. Ask the user the top level of questions and, using a single click on an option, review their answers against the contents of the <b>Possible Solutions/Required Actions</b> field. To view the question relating to an option, double-click on the option in the list box. The question relating to that option appears in the Questions field at the top of the window and the advice appears in the <b>Possible Solutions/ Required Actions</b> field. You may be able to access an object linked to that advice. When you double-click an option, it is listed on the <b>Session Dialog</b>. Remember that as this information can be saved to the call, a large amount of text will be built up as you view the different options, and this will then be added to the call <b>Actions and Solutions</b> on the <b>Call Details</b> window. You can also view the possible solution for each option by highlighting the option and keeping the current question displayed. Often you will just narrow down the range of possible causes and the advice will simply be to go on to the next question.
