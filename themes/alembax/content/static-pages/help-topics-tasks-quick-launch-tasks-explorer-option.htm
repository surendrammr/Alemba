                                                    <p>Quick Launch URLs are shortcuts that let you run a URL through the click of a link. Parameters such as task or call fields, or even fields on a CMDB item linked to the task/call can be passed to a URL. This is useful, for example if you want to easily access a website.</p>
                                                    <p> All quick launch URLs, including the parameters used, have been configured on the <a href="../admin%20system/quick%20launch.htm">Quick Launch</a> window in System Administration. For more information, see <a href="../admin%20system/quick%20launch.htm" class="PageNumber MCXref xref xrefPageNumber"><b>Quick Launch</b> on page 1</a>.</p>
                                                    <p class="note"> If you run a quick launch URL which uses CMDB item fields as parameters passed to the URL, <span class="GeneralVariablesProductName">ASM</span> will use the currently selected configuration item or service linked to the task. If no configuration item is selected, the one with the lowest reference number is used. </p>
