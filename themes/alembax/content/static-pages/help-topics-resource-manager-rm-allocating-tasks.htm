You will immediately see a timeframe within the pane highlighted in green to indicate the completion window for the task. If there is a task prior to this one, its timeframe will show in yellow; any following task's timeframe will show in blue. This highlighting is for information only; you do not have to allocate your task in this timeframe. If there is an OLA for the task or an SLA for the request, its breach time will be indicated by a red line.</li>

<li value="2">If you have the Skill Filter checkbox selected, and select an analyst who does not have the necessary skill set, as soon as you release the mouse, the task will return to the Unallocated Tasks pane</li>
