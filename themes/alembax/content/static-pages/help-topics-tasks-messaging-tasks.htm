<a name="top"></a>Messaging Tasks</h1>
                                                    <p>Messaging Tasks are tasks which can be used to notify analysts, relevant users, stakeholders and other relevant people about the progress of the current request. They enable an analyst to add recipients for sending email or pager messages at key points within a workflow process, and can be implemented automatically if required. They can be used anywhere in the workflow and are an excellent method for keeping users, analysts and key stakeholders informed of decisions and workflow progress. </p>
                                                    <p>Without this task, messaging from Tasks and Approvals is limited to notifying the task owner on activation, and notifying analysts when the active task is forwarded internally.</p>
                                                    <p>The Messaging Task allows you to do the following:</p>
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li value="1">Send messages to the request creator, officers, groups, external suppliers, request managers, request customers, stakeholders, stakeholders by CMDB profile, and other people associated with the request.</li>
                                                        <li value="2">Select a specific messaging template for each recipient grouping.</li>
                                                        <li value="3">Select multiple recipients for the messaging task.</li>
                                                        <li value="4">Either automate the sending of the messages once the task is activated, or configure it to be manually updated and completed.</li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                    <p>Messaging tasks can be customized with content specific to workflow branches, allowing you to include only relevant information.</p>
                                                    <p class="exampletext">Two Messaging Tasks branch from an approval. One is on the approval path, the other on the rejection path. The same recipients are defined for both but different templates have been defined. If it follows the approval path, the Messaging Task will send an email or message confirming that the decision has been approved; if it follows the rejection path, the Messaging Task will send an email or message advising that the decision has been rejected.</p>
                                                    <p>Different sets of recipients can receive different messages depending on which message template they have been linked to. Message recipients can even be defined within a workflow template, further streamlining the creation of change requests.</p>
