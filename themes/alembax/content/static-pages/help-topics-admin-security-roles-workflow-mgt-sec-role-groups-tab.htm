<a name="Workflow"></a>Workflow Management Security Role: Groups Tab</h1>
                                                    <p class="intro">You can assign workflow groups to a Workflow Management security role. Any Analyst who has been assigned the role will be considered a member of the groups that you link to the role on this tab. You can also set a default group for the role. Analysts can belong to multiple groups, but it is recommended that you set a default group for Analysts through the security role. Otherwise, the system group <b class="Bold">Unspecified</b> is set as an Analyst’s default group on the <a href="%7B%7B%20'help-managing-people-managing-people#Completing_Person_Details'%7CstaticPage%20%7D%7D#Completing_Person_Details">Person Details</a> window, and the Analyst will be able to see items that are assigned to other Analysts. </p>
                                                    <p>You can also set a default <i>approval</i> group. If a task is sent to a group for approval, only Analysts with that default approval group can approve the task.</p>
