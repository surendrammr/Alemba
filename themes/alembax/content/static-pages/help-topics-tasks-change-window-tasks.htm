                                                    <p class="intro"> Change Window tasks can be used to apply change windows to CMDB items (configuration items or services) that are linked to the current request. A change window is a duration when a CMDB item can be updated or changed.</p>
                                                    <p class="intro"> </p>
                                                    <p>Changes to the IT infrastructure must be carefully planned to ensure that services to users are disrupted as little as possible. Change Calendars reduce the risk of service disruption by specifying the periods of time in which changes should be made to a CMDB item. These will often be periods outside of service usage hours, such as at night or on weekends.</p>
                                                    <p>The Change Window Task enforces the selection of an allowed time period in which to make any changes. This helps to prevent changes from occurring at inappropriate times: not only when the service is in use but also when other key activities are being performed such as backups.</p>
                                                    <p>CMDB items that needs to be available during service timeframes are linked to a <b>Change Calendar</b>. Within that Change Calendar the windows in which changes can be made to that item are defined. A change window for a specified CMDB item is selected from within the Change Window Task. This updates the task implementation start and end times to reflect the times of the change window. If you wish,these dates can be populated to the implementation dates of the request itself.</p>
                                                    <p>The Define Change Window Task can be defined by the Request Manager prior to releasing the request. Alternatively, it can be defined by the analyst assigned to the task.</p>
                                                    <h2>Creating a Change Window Task</h2>
                                                    <p class="warning">The Change Window Task can be added to workflow templates but specific Change Windows should not be defined, as CMDB items should not be linked within templates.</p>
