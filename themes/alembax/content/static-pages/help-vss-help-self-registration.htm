                                                    <p class="note"> HTML email messages support text formatting, numbering, bullets, alignment, image attachment,  tables, HTML styles, stationery, signatures, and linking to Web pages. Because the most popular e-mail programs use HTML, it is the recommended format for Internet mail. Plain Text is used to specify the description when uploading objects, regardless of whether you are attaching objects to an HTML Knowledge entry or Bulletin Board item. When working with knowledge entries, plain text makes extensive use of knowledge article templates in which elements such as question, synopsis and answer are entered into fields. <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> then applies its own rules to render the article based on these fields.</p>
