                                                    <p>The Integration Platform enables you to perform actions, such as exchanging information, between your <span class="GeneralVariablesSystemName">ASM System</span>s and:</p>
                                                    <ul>

<b>Non Service Desk systems</b>, such as procurement, asset management, software license management and infrastructure management systems. This communication with non Service Desk systems enables <span class="GeneralVariablesProductName">ASM</span> to perform an orchestration function, where requests for task fulfillment are passed on to the appropriate system(s) to complete.</li>
                                                        <li value="2">
<b>Other <span class="GeneralVariablesSystemName">ASM System</span>s</b>. This means that several <span class="GeneralVariablesSystemName">ASM System</span>s can be installed and data passed from one another only when required.</li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                    <p>The integration of inbound and outbound actions is similar to <a href="%7B%7B%20'help-managing-events#top'%7CstaticPage%20%7D%7D#top">Event Management</a> but is not limited to the handling of event alerts. Furthermore, actions can be initiated both by <span class="GeneralVariablesProductName">ASM</span> and the external application.</p>
