This is because organizations define their IPK and workflow management operations in terms of a set of services designed to support one or more business needs. This set of services is known as the Service Portfolio.

                                                    <p>
In <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span>, service entities can be one of the following types:
</p>
                                                    <ul>

                                                    </ul>
                                                    <h2>ITIL and Service Management </h2>
                                                    <p>
ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) version 3 recommends that IT departments manage IT as a set of services rather than simply as a series of technologies and components. More specifically, ITIL highlights the importance of managing services across their entire lifecycle from request to retirement. This enables IT departments to gain a comprehensive view of all the services they provide and optimize service delivery. To achieve this, IT organizations need to implement effective Service Management. </p>
                                                    <p>
An IT service refers to an IT offering that an organization’s Users subscribe to and that is designed to support one or more business processes (for example, communication or information backup). Examples of services provided by IT departments include: network, storage, email, intranet, internet and phone messaging.
</p>
                                                    <p>A Service Portfolio, as defined in ITIL V3, is “the complete set of services that are managed by a Service Provider”. It includes three components, which correspond to the three lifecycle phases of a service:
</p>
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li value="1">
<b>Service Pipeline</b> – proposed services or those in development (those services are not yet available to Users).
</li>
                                                        <li value="2">
<b><span class="GeneralVariablesServiceRequestCatalog">Service Request Catalog</span></b> – services in use or available for deployment (typically visible to users through a service portal) – these are the services that Users can browse, and request if needed.
</li>
                                                        <li value="3">
<b>Retired Services</b> – services that are no longer in use.
Although retired services are no longer visible or available to Users, they still need to be recorded in the CMDB.</li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                    <p>ITIL represents the structure of the Service Portfolio with the following diagram:
</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        <img src="/storage/app/media/Help/images/service%20portfolio%20structure.png" class="screenshot"></p>
                                                    <p>The Portfolio should contain all information relating to the services offered by the IT department, including their lifecycle status (such as: analyzed, approved, developed, released, or retired), with each status corresponding to one of the three phases above. For example, while a service is in design phase, it is part of the Service Pipeline and is not visible to users; once a service is approved and resourced, it is integrated into the <span class="GeneralVariablesServiceRequestCatalog">Service Request Catalog</span> and becomes available to users. 
</p>
                                                    <p>The process of managing services throughout their lifecycle is referred to as Service Management or Service Portfolio Management.
</p>
                                                    <h3>Service Management and the CMDB
</h3>
                                                    <p>A Service Portfolio system should maintain information about each service that it manages. This information includes, for example, the service’s title, its description, its cost, and the business case supporting it. Recording this information helps IT departments control their Service Portfolio and manage it more efficiently. </p>
                                                    <p>
Information about a Service Portfolio is typically recorded in the CMDB, which is a cornerstone of an IT Service Management implementation. The Service Portfolio should be fully integrated into the CMDB so that you can view all the services that you provide to the business and visualize the relationships between those services and the underlying infrastructure components that support them. This includes the services in the process of being designed as well as services that have been retired. 
</p>
                                                    <p>The structure of the CMDB is important because it affects the way your IT Service Portfolio Management system works. The <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> CMDB is designed to meet this requirement. The Service Portfolio Management capability offered by <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> aligns with the ITIL model outlined above, enabling IT departments to implement effective service lifecycle management, improve compliance, and apply best practices.
</p>
                                                    <p>Service Actions and Service Bundles can be set to "Available to all Users", or restricted to subscriber groups.</p>
