This results in the indexing process being more efficient, as it returns results that are more meaningful. </p>
                                                    <p class="exampletext"> If the word ‘the’ was in the list of common words, a search based on the phrase “The Bulletin” would only return search results involving the word “Bulletin”.</p>
