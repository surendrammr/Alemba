This function is particularly useful in a distributed Help Desk environment where calls are transferred between different Service Desk Management systems (including <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> to <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span>). For details on how to associate an Outbound Action with an external supplier and contract, see <a href="configuring%20outbound%20actions.htm">Configuring Outbound Actions</a>.</p>
                                                    <p>When the call is forwarded externally to a supplier and contract associated with an Outbound Action, the call appears on the Service Portal for the external supplier to action and a CREATE message is automatically sent to the external system linked to this Outbound Action. What the external system does in response to this message is configured at the level of the external system itself. In addition, if you are using Service Level Management, any UC (Underpinning Contract) associated with this external supplier and contract is applied to the call.</p>
                                                    <p>The external source can then send UPDATE, NOTIFY, COMPLETE and NOT COMPLETE messages to <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> in relation to the Outgoing Action that was created.
