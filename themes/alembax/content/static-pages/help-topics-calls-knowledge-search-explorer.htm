                                                    <p>The <b>Knowledge Search</b> explorer option enables you to search for Knowledge Bank articles that you can link to the current call. </p>
                                                    <p>Selecting this option opens the <b>Knowledge Search</b> window with the service, type and description automatically updated from the call. </p>
                                                    <p>The service linked to the call automatically populates the CMDB Item field in the Knowledge Search criteria panel.</p>
                                                    <p>You can specify additional criteria for your search. Once the search results are displayed, you can select one or more articles that you want to link to the current call.</p>
                                                    <p>While the call description is automatically updated on the <b>Knowledge Search</b> window (into the <b>Search Text</b> field), this field is not selected as a criterion by which to search. This is by design, since running a search with a large amount of words will take a long time and most likely return no results. </p>
                                                    <p>If you want to use the call description in the Knowledge Search, you should review the words listed and then select the <b>Search Text</b> field so that it is used.</p>
