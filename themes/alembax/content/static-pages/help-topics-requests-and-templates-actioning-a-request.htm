                                                    <p>Once you have completed all of the necessary information in the Request Details window, you can action the request in a number of ways. All requests must be authorized, though this can be set up at template or request level. Then you can save, forward, defer or complete the request, as appropriate.</p>
                                                    <h2>Authorizing the Request</h2>
                                                    <p>For the request to be active, it must first be authorized.</p>
                                                    <p>Unless the workflow template on which the request is based was pre-authorized and <b>Authorization</b> was selected on the <a href="../admin%20workflow%20mgt/workflow%20management%20settings.htm">Workflow Management Settings</a> window, you must manually authorize the request:</p>
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li value="1">If <b>Authorization</b> was selected on the <a href="../admin%20workflow%20mgt/workflow%20management%20settings.htm">Workflow Management Settings</a> window but the workflow template was not pre-authorized, select the <a href="authorization%20explorer%20option.htm">Authorization</a> explorer option on the <b>Request Details</b> window.</li>
                                                        <li value="2">If <b>Authorization</b> was not selected on the <b>Workflow Management Settings</b> window, the request will be authorized as soon as you click <b>Save</b> (whether the workflow template was pre-authorized or not). </li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                    <p class="note">Tasks added to a pre-authorized request or to a request after it is authorized must also be authorized.</p>
                                                    <p>When an analyst logs a request, if the analyst has manager rights, then they are set as the request manager of that request. If the logging analyst does not have manager rights, then the request manager will be the authorizer, in the case where the template is pre-authorized, or the template creator, in the case where the template is not pre-authorized.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        </p>
<p>If a user logs a request through the Portal or an analyst without Manager rights in their Workflow Management security role logs a request through the main application or the Portal, the request manager will be set to the analyst who authorizes the request and the tasks within the request will be forwarded to the request recipient.</p>

                                                    <p>The <b>Save</b> button is used to save any information that you have entered on the request while keeping the <b>Request Details</b> window open. This is useful when you are working on a request over a period of time to save the information you have entered so that it does not get lost (such as in the event of a power failure). </p>
                                                    <p>If you want to save the information you have added and then close the <b>Request Details</b> window, you should click <b>Defer</b>. This allows you to save and close the request to work on it later.</p>

                                                    <p>The Defer option is used when you wish to record an action you have taken, or expenses etc. but are not ready to complete a request and do not need to forward it. When deferring a request, the request details and the actions taken to complete it are saved but action is temporarily postponed. This is useful, for example, if you are not ready to complete a request but do not need to forward it to another analyst at the present time. </p>
