                                                    <p>You can record measurements against an agreement. As part of the standard application, measurements are just text fields stored against the agreement. They do not interact with any other component of SLM or <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span>. Measurements can be integrated with other components of the application as part of a consulting project. </p>
