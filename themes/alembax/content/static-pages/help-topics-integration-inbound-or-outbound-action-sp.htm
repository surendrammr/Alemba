Any Inbound Actions configured for this source are not visible to the external system unless this option is selected. <p>You must complete the User and/or Organization fields. The User and the linked organization will be used to populate the User and/or Organization fields on the call or request logged as a result of the Inbound Action (unless specified otherwise at the level of the Action).</p>
<p class="note">If the User is linked to an organization, the Organization field is automatically populated when you select a User. If the linked organization is later changed, the User field is cleared. </p>
<p class="note">If no User is specified or if the specified User has been deleted from the system, the system will randomly select a User from the organization specified in the Organization field. </p>
<p class="note">If both the User and the organization no longer exist, the action will fail and notifications will be sent, if fault notifications have been configured.  </p>

If the transaction is not completed or failed within this period, the transaction is declared “timed out” and the attempt considered failed.<p class="note"> This setting applies to individual transactions (messages) for a particular action – not to the action itself. An Outbound Action has an unlimited amount of time after the CREATE transaction to send <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> a COMPLETE transaction. However, each individual UPDATE, NOTIFY, or CANCEL transaction related to that Outbound Action is bound by this setting.</p>
