The name of the SLM bar matches the type of agreement. If there are active/closed SLA events on the call, the SLA bar appears. If there are active/closed OLA events on the call, the OLA bar appears. If there are active/closed UC events on the call, the UC bar appears.</p>
                                                    <p>To view the name of the linked agreement, hover your cursor over the name of the agreement type displayed in the SLM bar.</p>

An agreement may trigger a number of events such as different types and levels of escalations, and breach.

Agreement events are closed off when a call is closed or resolved (a call may have a status of Open-Resolved if it has been forwarded to a closure group, for example, if closure rules are configured or through an IPK workflow rule). The Service Resumed button only appears if there is an open agreement on the call. Once clicked, it is removed until a new agreement is applied to the call.</p>

                                                    <p>The <b>Related Calls</b> panel contains the call alert matrix and appears below the Service window. The call alert matrix shows the number of open calls in the system that match the current call’s details based on the following <b>CI</b>, <b>CI Type</b>, <b>Location</b>, <b>Organization</b>, <b>Service</b> and <b>User</b> fields. These fields are the standard fields and any fields you add in <span class="GeneralVariablesDesignerName">ASM Designer</span> will not apply here.</p>
                                                    <p>The number of calls in the matrix is updated for each IPK status defined in your system as these details are specified. For example, if you select a CI or CI Type on the <b>Call Details</b> window, the call alert matrix will show the number of calls that have the same CI or CI Type selected. </p>
                                                    <p>By default, the <b>Related Calls</b> window will show the number of open calls that match the above options. However, by selecting the <b>Include Closed</b> checkbox, the <b>Related Calls</b> window will also display all the closed calls in real time. This setting is remembered by the system, and applied to all call windows you open.</p>
                                                    <p>Double-click on an alert option to automatically perform a search on all open calls and display a list of matching calls. </p>
                                                    <p>This search uses only active field values, not deleted ones. So, if you selected a CI Type on a call and subsequently deleted it, the call alert matrix will not include the deleted value in the search, and the number of calls in the search results may be different from the number shown in the matrix.</p>
                                                    <p class="exampletext">If you double-click on the <b>CI</b> option (and the configuration item has been defined as ‘Printer0123’ in the call), the search results will display a list of open calls that have ‘Printer0123’ defined as the configuration item.</p>
                                                    <p>Selecting more than one alert option will display the number of related calls for that combination of options in a new row titled Combination. Double-clicking in the combination row will display all the matching calls. </p>
