The Match Status for an external resource reflects the standing of the resource at the time of its discovery during the scan. It does not reflect the creation of, deletion of, or changes to a corresponding CMDB since that scan. These changes are not reflected until the next regulated scan of the source. <p>The Match Status can be:</p>
<ul>
<li value="1"> 
N/A – no matching criteria has been defined for this resource type; therefore, no reconciliation has been performed on this external resource.
</li>
<li value="2">Match – this resource has been matched to exactly one CMDB record.</li>
<li value="3">
No Match – no CMDB record has been found to match this resource.
</li>
<li value="4">Multiple – two or more CMDB records have been found to match this resource.
</li>
</ul>
<p class="note">Whenever an existing CMDB record is matched to an external resource, an informational event is recorded on the Integration Platform Activity Log.
</p>
<p>This indicates how the resource compares with the matching criteria specified in the resource type mapping, and can be NA, No Match, One Match, or Multiple Match.</p>
