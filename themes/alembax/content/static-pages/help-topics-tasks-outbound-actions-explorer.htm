                                                    <p>If an Outbound Action is triggered on a task, you can view the outbound action messages exchanged between <span class="GeneralVariablesProductName">ASM</span> and the external system relating to the Outbound Action. Outbound Actions can trigger when an Outbound Action Task is activated in a workflow, or when an External Supplier task is forwarded to a supplier and/or contract associated with the Outbound Action.</p>
