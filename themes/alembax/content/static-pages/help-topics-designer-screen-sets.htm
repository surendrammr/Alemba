<a name="top"></a><a name="About"></a>About Screen Sets</h1>
                                                    <p>Each entity type in <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span>, such as CMDB Item Type, Call, Request, Knowledge, or Person, has a standard set of screens known as a <b>screen set</b>. The ability to add or configure screens, forms or messages is controlled by screen sets.</p>
                                                    <p class="exampletext">The standard entity, Request, has a Request Screen Set, containing a Request Details screen for use in the main application, Request Review and Request Submission screens for use in the <span class="GeneralVariablesSelfServicePortalName">Self Service Portal</span>, a Default Form for use in the Service Desk and many standard Message Templates used to generate notifications based on events relating to requests (such as Request Update, Request Escalation, and so on).</p>
                                                    <p>The base screen set, Call, can consist of the following screen sets: Incident, Problem, Known Error, Major Incident, and Service Request. The Incident screen set can consist of its own Incident Details window, and an Incident Default Form.</p>
                                                    <p>Each screen set has <b>one</b> of the following screen types:</p>
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li value="1">
<b>Details screen</b> - used to create and edit the details of an entity, such as a call or CMDB item, in the main application</li>
                                                        <li value="2">
<b>Portal Review screen</b> - used to view the details of an entity on the <span class="GeneralVariablesSelfServicePortalName">Self Service Portal</span>
</li>
                                                        <li value="3">
<b>Portal Submission screen</b> - used to log service requests on the <span class="GeneralVariablesSelfServicePortalName">Self Service Portal</span>
</li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                    <p>If you want more than one of any of the above, you need to use <a href="#Custom">custom screen sets</a>. You can have as many message templates and service desk forms in one screen set as you need. </p>
                                                    <h2>
<a name="Custom"></a>Custom Screen Sets</h2>
                                                    <p>If you wish to have several screen types where only one screen type is permitted in the screen set, for example a particular Details window for logging minor service desk faults, you must define a <b>custom screen set</b>, based on the original. You can define custom screen sets for <a href="../admin%20ipk%20management/call%20screen%20sets.htm">calls</a> and<a href="%7B%7B%20'help-admin-ipk-management-customer-survey-screen-set#top'%7CstaticPage%20%7D%7D#top"> User Surveys </a>in IPK Management within System Admin, and <a href="../admin%20workflow%20mgt/screen%20sets%20for%20requests%20tasks.htm">requests</a> and <a href="%7B%7B%20'help-admin-workflow-mgt-screen-sets-for-requests-tasks#Creating'%7CstaticPage%20%7D%7D#Creating">tasks</a> in Workflow Management within System Admin. They act in exactly the same way as the screen sets on which they are based. </p>
                                                    <p class="warning">You cannot create custom screen sets for CMDB items, as they are automatically created based on CMDB type. If necessary, the <a href="%7B%7B%20'help-configuring-screens#top'%7CstaticPage%20%7D%7D#top">screens</a> and <a href="%7B%7B%20'help-configuring-fields#top'%7CstaticPage%20%7D%7D#top">fields</a> within the screen sets can be configured.</p>
                                                    <p>Once you have defined the custom screen set, you can <a href="%7B%7B%20'help-configuring-screens#top'%7CstaticPage%20%7D%7D#top">then configure existing screens</a> and <a href="creating%20screens.htm">create custom screens</a> for the new screen set. If you do not define a particular screen design for the custom screen set, it will just use the screen design defined for the original screen set.</p>
                                                    <p class="exampletext">You could define a new Request Screen Set for a procurement request for items over $100 in Workflow Management administration. You could then link the new screen set to the workflow template for the procurement request. Finally, you could use <span class="GeneralVariablesDesignerName">ASM Designer</span> to configure the new portal submission form which the User is required to complete.</p>
