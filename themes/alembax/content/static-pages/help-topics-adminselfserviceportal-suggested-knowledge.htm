The list of displayed knowledge articles is based on the data entered into the submission form fields, with the most relevant articles at the top. Users can review suggested knowledge article details without leaving the submission form. If the article solves the issue they can acknowledge this by selecting <b>Solved! Close my call</b>. This action increments the <b>Help Factor</b> rating of the knowledge article, and automatically closes the call they were logging.</p>

If the Description field is unpopulated, then the matching is performed on the Type, Service, and Config Item fields. If there is no data populating any of the four standard fields, no knowledge articles are returned in Suggested Knowledge.</p>
                                                    <p>When matching on Description field, knowledge articles are returned which contain any words specified in the submission form's Description field, not necessarily in the same order. This does not include an exact phrase search. Nor will it retrieve text that has another form of the word or a synonym. For example, if entering “Join”, it will not retrieve “Joined” as a match.</p>
