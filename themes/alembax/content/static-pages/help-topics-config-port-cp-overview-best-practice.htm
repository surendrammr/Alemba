                                                    <p class="intro">Config Port is a powerful tool for developing and transferring screens, email templates, and system settings between systems; however if used incorrectly problems may occur. This topic contains an overview explaining the basic principles behind Config Port, as well as recommended best practices to avoid the common pitfalls. A detailed explanation of Config Port is available in the <a href="configuration%20portability.htm" class="MCXref xref">Configuration Portability</a> topic.</p>

                                                    <h3>Export</h3>
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li value="1">On the Config Port Source (DEV) environment the elements to export are selected<ul><li value="1">Config Port is run and the data exported to file</li></ul>
</li>
                                                        <li value="2">Where there is a null CONFIG_PORT_GUID the value is allocated<ul>
<li value="1">Static records are allocated static GUIDs during install and patch</li>
<li value="2">User-created records are allocated GUIDs during export, the GUIDs are created by an algorithm</li>
<li value="3">User-created records are allocated GUIDs a record at a time, and then all are exported to file</li>
</ul>
</li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                    <h3>Import</h3>
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li value="1">On the Target system areas to import are selected from export file<ul><li value="1">Config Port is run and the data imported</li></ul>

                                                        <li value="2">GUIDs from the Config Port Source (DEV) are matched to GUIDs on the Target environment<ul>
<li value="1">If there is no match on GUID, various properties of the item are looked up, generally name and partition</li>
<li value="2">When matching on properties, the Config Port excludes all items with a GUID</li>
<li value="3">If a match on properties is identified:<ul>
<li value="1">the GUID is set so the items are always in sync in the future (between the Source and Target environments)</li>
<li value="2">other properties are updated (i.e. status)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li value="4">If there is no match on GUID and no match on defined properties, a new record is created on the Target environment with the GUID set from the  Source environment (DEV)</li>
</ul>
</li>
                                                    </ul>

                                                    <p>The import and export sequence is critically important to a successful outcome. Follow these steps to ensure all changes are developed on the correct database and imported successfully to the master target system.</p>
