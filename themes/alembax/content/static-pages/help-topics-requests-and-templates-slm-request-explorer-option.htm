If so, the agreement is applied. </li>
                                                        <li value="3">If no matches are found for any of the fields, <span class="GeneralVariablesProductName">ASM</span> checks for a default agreement; if one is found, it is applied. </li>

When a new agreement is applied to a request, keep in mind that the target times for all events will be based on the original time the request was either authorized or created (depending on the SLA Immediate setting), not the time you changed the agreement over. For example, you authorized the request and Agreement A is applied to the automatically. According to its matrix, it will breach the agreement in one hour. Half an hour later, you change over to agreement B, which also has a time of 45 minutes until breach. However, changing the agreement has not “reset the clock”; you now only have 15 minutes before the agreement is breached, even though it has just come into effect on the agreement.</p>

<li value="1">If <b>Lock Workflow SLA</b> is selected for this agreement, the original agreement applied to the request remains the same, regardless of any changes made to the fields of the request, even if those details were used to automatically select the agreement in the first place. </li>
<p class="note">In this case, only an analyst with the appropriate security rights can override the agreement manually on the Request Service Level Management window Note that if an agreement is replaced manually, it can only ever be replaced manually (even if the Lock Workflow SLA option is not selected).</p>
<li value="2">If <b>Lock Workflow SLA</b> is not selected and the original agreement assigned by the system still applies (that is, it has not been manually reassigned), the agreement selection criteria are reassessed each time the request is updated and saved.<ul>
<li value="1">If another agreement is found, then the current agreement is automatically closed (as well as all its linked SLM events) and the new agreement is applied. The new agreement’s SLM events are then back dated to the start time of the request.</li>
<li value="2">If no new matching agreement is found and the original agreement is still applicable, then no changes are made.</li>
<li value="3">If no new matching agreement is found and the original agreement is no longer applicable, then the original agreement is closed (as well as all its linked SLM events) and no agreement is applied to the request.</li>
<li value="4">If the request has no agreement assigned to it and a matching agreement is found, then this agreement is applied and the agreement’s events are back dated to the start time of the request.</li>
