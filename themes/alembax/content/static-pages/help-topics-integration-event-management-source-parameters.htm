Asynchronous transactions, on the other hand, are transactions that do not complete or fail immediately: the connector notifies <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> within a specified time as to whether the transaction has completed or failed. The timeout is the maximum time given to the connector to notify <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span>. If the transaction is not completed or failed within this period, the transaction is declared “timed out” and the attempt considered failed. </p>

For example, an event has an unlimited amount of time after the CREATE event to send <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> a RESOLVE or a DELETE transaction. However, each individual UPDATE or NOTIFY transaction related to that event is bound by this setting.</p>
