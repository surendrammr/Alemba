                                                    <p>Activation Rules allow tasks to be triggered, or activated, if some, all, or a specific subset of tasks in the preceding step of the workflow are completed. They are implemented using weightings, or values. Each task in the preceding step is given a value, and a threshold value must be reached for the dependent task to be triggered. You can assign different weightings to specific approvals, allowing you to customize your requests dynamically, based on your organization’s structure. This makes workflows much more efficient. For example, approvals can be sent to multiple managers without requiring all of them to be completed, so requests don’t get delayed waiting for approvals. Here are some sample scenarios that illustrate how Activation Rules are used as part of a Change Management workflow:</p>
