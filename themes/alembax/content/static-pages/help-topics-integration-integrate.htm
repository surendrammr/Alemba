                                                    <p><span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> provides a common Integration Platform to set up various types of integration with external applications and technologies with a view to automate the transfer of information (for the resolution of calls or the completion of tasks, for example), the management of alerts across different systems, and the population of the <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> CMDB with externally discovered resources.</p>
                                                    <h2>The Integrated Platform</h2>
                                                    <p>The <span class="GeneralVariablesProductName">ASM</span> Integration platform is designed to enable easy integration with external applications, data sources and products in <span class="GeneralVariablesProductName">ASM</span>. The platform provides a powerful user interface granting end-users maximum configurability of all their integrations from a single, unified administration area accessible from via the application client. The platform defines a minimal set of connector interfaces that provide the basic services that are required by each integration, which makes developing plug-in connectors much quicker.</p>
                                                    <p>The Integration platform supports four integration scenarios. Each scenario is associated with a particular type of data.</p>
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li value="1">The <b>Federated CMDB</b>, which allows you to communicate with external applications (network discovery tools or LDAP-compliant directory servers) to discover resources on these applications. Once detected, those resources can be imported into <span class="GeneralVariablesProductName">ASM</span> as CMDB records or linked to existing CMDB records.</li>
                                                        <li value="2">

                                                    <p>Communication with supported external applications is performed through a series of connectors (one per external application) supplied with <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> and which must be installed on the <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> server.</p>
                                                    <p>Once a connector is installed, the system administrator must:</p>
