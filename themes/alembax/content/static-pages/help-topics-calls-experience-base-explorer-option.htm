                                                    <p>The Experience Base explorer option enables you to carry out a search of previously solved problems based on any combination of the attributes displayed. When this option is selected from a current call, the <b>Call Search</b> window appears with the call details automatically included in the search criteria. </p>
                                                    <p>If you are using the <b>Text Retrieval</b> module and your system is configured for it, you will also be able to search for calls on any word in the call description. You may also specify if the search is only to include Closed or Open calls, or only those recorded in the Experience Base, by clicking on the relevant options. </p>
                                                    <p>When you have selected your search criteria, click <b>Search</b>. To change your search criteria, you may remove that entry by clearing the selection of the required search criteria.</p>
                                                    <p>Past issues matching the search criteria and their solutions are displayed in the Search results window. From there, a call may be selected for viewing previous issue details to determine if they are relevant to the current call. Previous solutions can be suggested to the user and the text can be copied and pasted into the current call in the call <b>Actions and Solutions</b> field.</p>
