                                                    <p class="intro">According to ITIL, a call can be logged as an Incident, Problem, Major Incident, Known Error or Service Request, collectively referred to as ‘IPK’ in <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span>. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">IPK Statuses</span> window enables you to add new IPK statuses and manage existing ones.  </p>
                                                    <p>A call is generally logged as an <b>Incident</b> (that is, a minor incident). <b>Major Incidents</b> are linked to Incidents, where workaround information is available. </p>
                                                    <p>If a number of similar Incidents are logged relating to an issue, one of those Incidents can be promoted to, or can initiate, a <b>Problem</b>. A Major Incident can also be promoted to a Problem. </p>
                                                    <p>When the source of the reported issue is diagnosed, Problems can be promoted to, or can initiate, <b>Known Errors</b>.</p>
                                                    <p>Users can log a request for service (<b>Service Request</b>) if they want any additional service provided. </p>
                                                    <p class="note">The default IPK statuses can be renamed, re-ordered in the list, and assigned a different abbreviation. You can create new IPK statuses, but cannot delete the default statuses: Incident, Problem, Known Error, Major Incident, and Service Request.</p>
