<a name="top"></a>Managing Requests</h1>
                                                    <p>In any organization, there is usually a defined procedure which people must follow in order to implement change – this process may consist of more than twenty steps or may even require approval from some form of management. Workflow is a term used to describe any change process, outlining the necessary tasks and approvals required for its completion. Examples of change which may exist in an organization include the following:</p>
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li value="1">An employee entering the organization</li>
                                                        <li value="2">An employee leaving the organization</li>
                                                        <li value="3">Replacing an entire computer network</li>
                                                        <li value="4">Booking a plane ticket for business travel</li>
                                                        <li value="5">Implementing an upgrade to a piece of hardware</li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                    <p>Workflow management is the practice of ensuring all changes within an organization are carried out in a planned and authorized manner. It is a component of quality frameworks such as ISO 9001, BS 8018, ISO 20 000 and ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library). </p>
                                                    <p>Within workflow management, all workflows are implemented following a Request for Change (RFC). </p>
                                                    <h2>Lifecycle of a Request</h2>
                                                    <p>Requests are created when change is required, for example when you must implement a workaround to resolve a call logged at the Service Desk. When a request is created, the appropriate template, including predefined attributes and a dependency diagram linking all tasks and approvals, must be selected. </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        <img src="/storage/app/media/Help/images/workflow%20management/request%20lifecycle_576x300.png" style="width: 576;height: 300;" class="screenshot">

                                                    <p>Given the lifecycle of a request and the high number of requests which must be created in order for change to occur, it is important to use the appropriate system tools in which to monitor and keep track of all requests and tasks currently taking place. <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> enables analysts with the appropriate security permissions to effectively create, authorize, observe and report on every change request throughout its lifecycle. </p>
