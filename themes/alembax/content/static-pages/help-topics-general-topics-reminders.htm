                                                    <p class="intro">In <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span>, Analysts can configure reminders on calls, requests, and tasks to send reminder notifications by email or pager at a specified date and time to themselves or a specified recipient. Reminders can be configured to send one reminder notification, or to repeatedly send notifications at specified intervals for a specified number of repeats.</p>
                                                    <h2 class="Prerequisite">Before you start</h2>
                                                    <ul class="prereq">
                                                        <li value="1">Reminders cannot be configured on automated tasks, such as the closure or messaging task, if those tasks have the 'Automated' checkbox selected. </li>
                                                        <li value="2">You cannot configure reminders at workflow template level. You must be in a specific request. </li>
                                                        <li value="3">Repeat Reminders are only available on SQL systems.</li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                    <p> Single Reminders are configured on the Defer, Forward Internal, and Forward External screens of calls, active tasks, and submitted requests. The Analyst who sets the reminder (the Current Analyst of the call, request, or task) receives the reminder notification by email.</p>
                                                    <p> Repeat Reminders are configured in the Repeat Reminders window which is accessed from the Explorer Menu of active calls, requests, and tasks, and also from call templates, workflow templates, and tasks in workflow templates. Repeat Reminders can be configured to send one or more reminders to one or multiple recipients by pager or email.</p>
                                                    <p class="exampletext"><b>Single Reminder</b> <br> An Analyst configures a reminder on a call while deferring it, to remind themselves to contact the User who logged the call. At the defined time, the Analyst receives a reminder email.<br></p>
                                                    <p class="exampletext"><b>Repeat Reminder</b> <br> A User Approval Task in a workflow template is configured  with a repeating reminder sent to the recipient of the task. Each request created from that workflow template will contain the User Approval with its configured repeating reminder. The recipient of the User Approval Task will receive email reminders until they complete the task or until the defined number of repeats is reached.</p>
                                                    <p class="tip">Reminders can trigger a Stored Procedure. This may be useful if you want to close a call or task after the last reminder is generated. Contact your local Alemba Account Manager to discuss a Professional Services engagement to create one tailored for your business needs.</p>
