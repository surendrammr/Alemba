                                                    <p class="intro">As part of the process for specifying the details of a CMDB item, you may need to link the record to other CMDB items to which it is related. For example, you can link a service such as email to a configuration item such as a mail server. Or you can link an organization to a series of cost centers. This enables you to identify the impact a problem or outage will have on a CMDB item and the items that are linked to it. The links can be viewed graphically on the <a href="cmdb%20linking%20diagram.htm">CMDB Linking Diagram</a>. </p>
                                                    <p class="intro"> </p>
                                                    <p class="intro">You may also want to <a href="#Viewing">view these details</a> to ensure that link mapping has been performed successfully as part of scheduled integration, as well as viewing links that you have manually created.</p>
                                                    <p>First, your system administrator creates <a href="../admin%20cmdb/cmdb%20link%20types.htm">link types</a>, specifying which CMDB item types may be linked, as well as the type of relationship the two items can have. You can also set the impact relationship for the link type.</p>
                                                    <p>Then you create the links within the CMDB Item Details window. </p>
                                                    <p class="note">Only the CMDB items linked through the <a href="#Adding">Linked Items</a> tab in the CMDB Item Details window appear on the linking diagram. Items linked through an extension field that has been added to the CMDB Item Details window in <span class="GeneralVariablesDesignerName">ASM Designer</span> will not appear.</p>
                                                    <p>There is no limit to the number of links you can create between CMDB items, but certain relationships may require several links. For example, if you have software that is being used across a network, it may have a lot of people ("Users") using it, but you would not be able to link the same software to lots of individual Users. Instead, you would have to link the software to different hardware items, such as workstations in the network, and link the workstations to the Users.</p>
                                                    <p>Most CMDB Details windows display a linking panel with tabs for each of the entities that can be linked to the current entity type. For example, the Configuration Items Details window has tabs that enable you to link:</p>
                                                    <ul>
