                                                    <p>Administrators can set up incoming and outgoing email accounts on the <a href="../admin%20system/email%20settings.htm">Email Settings</a> window, accessible from the System Administration.</p>
                                                    <p>Incoming and Outgoing Email run through the <span class="GeneralVariablesMessagingServiceName">ASM Messaging Service</span> – this is a polling service that operates under the <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> application - which checks these accounts at regular one-minute intervals. </p>
                                                    <p>In the case of incoming emails, the service analyzes the subject heading of the email(s) it picks up and acts according to any key words found in the subject line. Click <a href="recognized%20incoming%20subject%20lines.htm">here</a> to see which subject lines are accepted or rejected by <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span>.</p>
                                                    <p>In the case of outgoing emails, if an instruction to send an email has been put into the message table, an email is sent through one of the configured outgoing servers.
