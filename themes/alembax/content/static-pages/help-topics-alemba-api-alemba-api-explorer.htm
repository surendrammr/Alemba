                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li value="1">
<b>Entities</b>. All of the available entities appear in a tree in the <b>Entities</b> pane on the left. The selected entity appear in blue, parent physical entities in white and logical ones (which you cannot select) in gray. </li>
                                                        <li value="2">The <b>Entity details

</b> are displayed in the center pane. You can scroll down to see more information.</li>
                                                        <li value="3">The <b>Properties

</li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                    <p> </p>
                                                    <p>

                                                    <p>When you first log in to the API Explorer, the <b>Call</b> entity appears (see <a href="%7B%7B%20'help-aa-programmers-guide#API'%7CstaticPage%20%7D%7D#API" class="MCXref xref">API structure</a>). Clicking on any of the other entities in the <b>Entities</b> pane relocates you at that object. You can expand or contract the tree to explore the entities. </p>
                                                    <p>Alternatively, use the <b>Search</b> field above the tree, which returns a list of matches that is refined as you type. If the item is currently not visible in the tree, it expands to show where that entity is located in the hierarchy.

</p>
                                                    <p>Your current position in the entity hierarchy is reflected in the breadcrumb trail above that panel. Physical entities are in black, logical ones are grayed out. You can select any physical entity in the breadcrumb trail to go to that entity. The currently selected entity is shown in blue.
