                                                    <h1>Mapping Fields to be Updated by a Transaction</h1>
                                                    <p>When adding the transaction details, you can map fields to be updated by the transaction. Fields are defined in the mapping table on the <b>Manage CMDB transaction details</b> window. </p>
                                                    <p>For the transactions which delete items or links, the fields will firstly be updated to the values set in the mapping table, before the items/links are deleted. In the case of transactions which manage links between CMDB entities, you can map fields relating to the Link Details.</p>
                                                    <p>You can map the fields relating to the Transaction Details record(s) created by the particular asset management transaction. </p>
                                                    <p>You can map both standard data fields as well as custom fields added through the <a href="../designer/creating%20fields.htm"><span class="GeneralVariablesDesignerName">ASM Designer</span></a>.</p>
