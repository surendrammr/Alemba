                                                    <p>You can configure up to nine levels of sub-types. The additional types can be configured to inherit the properties of their parents, or have their own custom screen sets. You can also restrict access to specific types and sub types available to analysts through the <b><a href="../admin%20security%20roles/config%20mgt%20sec%20role%20-%20cmdb.htm">CMDB</a></b> tab of their <span class="crossref" style="font-weight: bold;">Configuration Management Security Role</span>.</p>

The Hardware Type can inherit the properties of Configuration Item, or you can configure it to use a <a href="../designer/screen%20sets.htm">custom screen set</a>. When you add a new printer, you select the <b>Printer</b> type and the appropriate Details window appears.</p>
