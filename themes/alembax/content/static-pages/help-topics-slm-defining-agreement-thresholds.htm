<a name="top"></a>Defining Agreement Thresholds</h1>
                                                    <p>Thresholds define the points at which an agreement should start escalation events, and the point at which an agreement is breached. Thresholds are based upon matrices, which are defined by your administrator. </p>
                                                    <p>You can define IPK and Workflow Thresholds for SLAs, OLAs, and UCs.</p>
                                                    <p>A matrix is a table containing threshold times. The actual times in the matrix are (usually) based upon Priority, and either Config Item or Problem Type. </p>
                                                    <p class="exampletext">A matrix may set the breach time at 30 minutes for all high priority calls and 60 minutes for lower priority calls, but calls with a CMDB Type of Server have half those times.</p>
                                                    <h2>Matrices and Factors</h2>
                                                    <p>Thresholds are defined for agreements by applying matrices to escalation and breach times. Escalation times should always be lower than breach times. Remember, escalations are warnings that occur within a system to prevent agreements from being breached. If your escalation times are the same as your breach times, calls will not escalate until it is too late, that is, when an agreement breach has occurred. </p>
                                                    <p>Rather than setting up many complicated matrices based on different types and levels of escalation and breaches, <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> lets you apply factors to a matrix. Factors are numbers that multiply all the existing times in a matrix by a certain amount. </p>
                                                    <p class="exampletext">You might have an agreement breach matrix for SLAs defined by your administrator. You want to set up breach and escalation times based on that matrix for your current agreement. You are using Three Level Resolve Escalation. Let us assume for the purpose of this example that the matrix you are applying has one time, 100 minutes, for all combinations of Problem and Config Item Types.</p>
                                                    <p>You want to set first level escalation to occur at 40 minutes, second level to occur at 60 minutes and third level escalation to occur at 80 minutes. The agreement is breached at the 100 minute mark (that is, if the call has not been resolved by 100 minutes).</p>
                                                    <p>To do this, you don’t need multiple matrices for each of these escalation levels. You would just apply the same matrix at 1st, 2nd and 3rd escalation levels with a factor of 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 respectively. The table below shows how this works.</p>
