<a name="top"></a>Creating an SLM Start Clock/Stop Clock Task</h1>
                                                    <p>  SLM Start Clock and SLM Stop Clock tasks enable you to set explicit points in your workflow where you want the clock on a SLA linked to a request to started or suspended. SLAs linked to a request will be closed once the request to which it is linked is set to an open-resolved state of closed.</p>
                                                    <p>Within <span class="GeneralVariablesProductName">ASM</span>, SLAs linked to a request are automatically started as soon as the request becomes authorized, and closed with closure of the request. However, when considering real world situations, there are often pre-approval and post-implementation steps that occur outside of when an agreement should be run. As a result, there can be a significant time period from when a pre-authorized request is created to when it is actually approved to be implemented, causing any SLAs on the request to breach. SLM Start Clock and Stop Clock tasks enable you to explicitly specify on your workflow when a SLA linked to a request shall start and suspend, meaning that your request SLAs will not unexpectedly breach.</p>
                                                    <p>The <b>SLM Start Clock</b> task is used to start or resume an SLA linked to the current request. The SLM Start Clock task performs the same function as the <b>Start Clock</b> button on the <a href="../requests%20and%20templates/request%20service%20window.htm">Request Service Window</a>. Similarly, the <b>SLM Stop Clock</b> task is used to suspend a SLA linked to the current request. The SLM Stop Clock task performs the same function as the <b>Stop Clock</b> button on the <a href="../requests%20and%20templates/request%20service%20window.htm">Request Service Window</a>.</p>
                                                    <p>It is possible that when the SLM Start Clock/Stop Clock task becomes active, it will not be able to start/suspend the SLA. This can occur when:</p>
