This window displays all the CMDB item fields defined in your system, including both standard fields and fields added through the <span class="crossref"><a href="../designer/using%20designer.htm"><span class="GeneralVariablesDesignerName">ASM Designer</span></a></span>. </p>
                                                    <p>Multiple CMDB items of the same base type (for example multiple CIs) can be linked to a call if CMDB fields have been added using Designer. The CMDB selection priority window enables you to order the relative importance of each field when applying an agreement. This window is only relevant if extensible CMDB item fields have been added in the Call Details window.</p>

Both Server A and Server B are linked to a call through the Configuration Item 1 and Configuration Item 2 fields respectively (the Configuration Item 2 field was added using <span class="GeneralVariablesDesignerName">ASM Designer</span>).</p>
