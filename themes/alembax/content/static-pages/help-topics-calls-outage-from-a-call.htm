                                                    <p>Outages can be created from a call, request, or task.</p>
                                                    <p>Outages that are created from a call are always unplanned and are logged as a result of a user having an issue with a configuration item or service against which you can log an outage. Outages that are created from requests or tasks are always planned, and you can inform your users about planned outages when you schedule them through requests or tasks. This information can be posted to the <a href="../bulletins/managing%20bulletins.htm">Bulletin Board</a>. Planned outages can be logged against only those CMDB items that are linked to the request. You can also create outages against all items that are dependent on the linked item.</p>
                                                    <p>Outages that have been created from requests and tasks can be viewed by selecting the Outages and Change Windows explorer option. Outages logged through tasks also appear on the Outages and Change Windows window.</p>
                                                    <p class="note">Outages can be tracked you are using Availability Management, and if the selected CMDB item has availability tracking enabled.</p>

The <b>Outage</b> option indicates that an outage will be logged against the selected config item(s). The <b>Link Outage</b> option links this call to outages against CMDB items which are linked to and dependent on the selected item(s). The <b>Description</b> column displays the current description of the outage. On creating an outage, the description cannot be added directly into the browse table, but must be specified in the <b>Outage Description</b> field.</li>
