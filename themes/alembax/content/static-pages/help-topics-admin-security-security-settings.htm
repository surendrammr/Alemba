                                                    <p>Integrated Security allows Analysts to use their workstation login ID and password to access <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span>. This means that when they launch <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span>, they do not need to enter a username and password, which makes logging in quicker. However, it also means that only the Analyst logged in to a particular workstation can access <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> from that workstation. You will still need to select the system you want to work with if there is more than one (such as Dev, Test, etc).</p>
                                                    <p class="note">If you want to log in using the default <b>Admin</b> account and use integrated security, append <span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 11pt;">noauth=true</span> to the system URL to bring up the login window (e.g.: .../core.aspx?noauth=true). However, most administration functions can be performed by any Analyst as long as they have the permissions through their <a href="../admin%20security%20roles/general%20access%20security%20role.htm">General Access security role</a>.</p>
