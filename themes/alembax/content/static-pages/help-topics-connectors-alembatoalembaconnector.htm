                                                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                                                    <p>The <span class="GeneralVariablesProductName">ASM</span> to <span class="GeneralVariablesProductName">ASM</span> interoperability concept basically allows for the creation of calls and requests on one <span class="GeneralVariablesSystemName">ASM System</span> (the Receiver) triggered by actions sent from another <span class="GeneralVariablesSystemName">ASM System</span> (the Creator).</p>
                                                    <p>The type of actions that are implemented and whether calls or requests are logged in the Receiver system is part of the Integration Platform settings in both systems, while creating adequate transactions, ensuring proper communication and maintaining reconciled information between the two systems are amongst the <span class="GeneralVariablesProductName">ASM</span> to <span class="GeneralVariablesProductName">ASM</span> connector duties.</p>
                                                    <p>The connector operation is symmetrical. This means that in some instances one of the systems acts as the Creator, creating calls or requests in the other system, and in other instances the same system acts as the Receiver, calls or requests being created internally based on instructions sent by the other system.</p>
                                                    <h2>Use Case Scenario</h2>
                                                    <p>The interoperability concept can be broken down into several use cases that are listed in the table below.</p>
