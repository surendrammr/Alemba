<a name="Partitio"></a>Partitioning by Analyst or Screen Set</h2>
                                                    <p>You can partition your system in two ways: </p>
                                                    <ul class="ul_3">
                                                        <li class="ListParagraph_2" value="1">By Analyst </li>
                                                        <li class="ListParagraph_2" value="2">By Screen Set</li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                    <h3>
<a name="Partitioning_by_Officer"></a>Partitioning by Analyst </h3>
                                                    <p>This is the most common type of partitioning. Each Analyst is allocated access to one or more partitions. They can only see items in their partition(s), if that type of item has been partitioned. </p>
                                                    <p>For example, a business might decide to have partitions for its different locations, New York and San Francisco, with partitioning enabled for <b>Call Details</b> and <b>configuration items</b>. Analysts who only have access to the New York partition would only be able to see and log calls and create configuration items in the New York partition. Analysts who only have access to the San Francisco partition will only be able to work with calls and configuration items in that partition. Analysts who have access to both partitions will be able to access all of the items.</p>
                                                    <h3>
<a name="Partitioning_by_Screen_Set"></a>Partitioning by Screen Set</h3>
                                                    <p>In this method, partitioning is based on the screen used. Analysts are still allocated partitions, but when logging a Call, Request or Task they can choose what screen to use, and the partition of the item is based on that screen.</p>
                                                    <p>For example, a business could set up two screen types, <b>Accounting</b> and <b>Payroll</b>, to reflect two different departments, and partition by screen set. If an Analyst is allocated the Accounting partition and they create a User from the menu, the User will be in the Accounting partition. However, the Analyst can choose to log a call in the Accounting partition or the Payroll partition by selecting the appropriate screen set. If the Analyst logs a call in the Payroll partition, and then creates a User linked to that call, that User will also be in the Payroll partition.</p>
                                                    <p>Partitioning by Screen thus functions similarly to Partitioning by Analyst, but with the important distinction that any actions taken on or from a partitioned screen are based in the partition of the screen, not the Analyst taking those actions. </p>
