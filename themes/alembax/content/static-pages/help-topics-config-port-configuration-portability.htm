                                                    <h1>Configuration Portability</h1>
                                                    <p>Organizations often set up test systems when they implement major changes to an existing production system. The test system is analyzed to ensure that all changes have been applied correctly before updating the production environment. It is imperative for organizations to follow this procedure in order to reduce the likelihood of errors or failures when these changes are implemented on the production system. </p>
                                                    <p><span class="GeneralVariablesSystemName">ASM System</span>s are business-critical and require complex configuration and setup by administrators. As a result, it is typical to set up a test system for <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span>, ensure the setup reflects the organization’s requirements, make changes if required, and then recreate the settings and data from the test system into the production system. Depending on the scale of an organization’s operations, this task can be time-consuming. </p>
                                                    <p><b>Configuration Portability</b> enables you to copy selected configuration settings from one system to another system using a simple export and import mechanism. All this can be performed directly from the client application, which means that you do not need to have access to the <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> server to import and export configuration settings. This saves time and minimizes human error by avoiding the need to manually configure two identical systems if moving from a test environment to a live environment.  </p>
                                                    <p>Once an organization has developed screens and configured settings on a development system (referred to as the <b>source</b>), the changes are imported and validated in the test system (referred to as the <b>target</b> ), and then imported into the production system (referred to as the <b>master target</b> ). Configuration Portability enables you to select the configuration settings you want to copy, export the settings from the source system, and then import them into the master target system. </p>
                                                    <p>You can transfer administration settings pertaining to functional areas such as Service Desk, Workflow Management, Configuration Management and Service Level Management. The following data can be ported:</p>

                                                    <h2>How Configuration Portability Works</h2>
                                                    <p>The data transfer between two systems is a two-step process. The data must first be <i>exported</i> from the source system (for example, the development environment), and then <i>imported</i> into the target system (for example, the test or pre-production environment) or the master target system (for example, the production environment).</p>
                                                    <p>To copy data between two systems, a common mechanism for matching the source and target data is used. <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> applies a <b>Global Unique Identifier (GUID)</b> as the matching key to each database entry across database instances. This allows renamed text fields, for example, to be recognized during the import process. Two items with different GUIDs are identified as different items.</p>
                                                    <p class="note">Before exporting the production database to the development system, it is recommended that you first run the <b>Config Portability GUID Assignment.scp</b> via the server console to allocate unique identifiers (GUIDs) to any fields missing a GUID so the system properties remain synchronized when using Configuration Portability.</p>
                                                    <p class="note">Custom schema files go in the <b>Config</b> directory and allow you to add additional elements. Schema files are version specific and this option should only be used by an experienced developer.</p>
                                                    <p>The following reconciliation rules are applied when configuration data is imported to a system with existing data:</p>
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <p class="note">In the explanations below, "target" refers to both a target system and a master target system.</p>
                                                        <li value="2">Items in the source and target systems are identified as being the same if the target item does not have a GUID, but has the same entity and partition as the item in the source system. The target item is then filled with the GUID from the source.</li>
                                                        <li value="3">If a value is active in the source system and no matching value is found in the target system, a new value (same as that in the source) is created in the target system. If the partition is not relevant, it is not considered as a reconciliation criterion.</li>
                                                        <p class="exampletext">If the Finance workflow group (present in the source system) does not exist in the target system, it is added in the target system.</p>

                                                        <li value="4">If a value exists in the target system but not in the source system, the value in the target system is kept (it is not deleted).</li>
                                                        <li value="5">If a value has been deleted in the source system, it is imported into the target system as a deleted value.</li>

                                                        <p class="note">Name case is not taken into consideration for name matching. In addition, if the GUID is not present in the target item (that is, porting has not occurred), the whitespace character (represented below with “_” character) in the name of the target item is affected as follows - <br><br>“Significant_” is replaced with “Significant”<br>“_Significant” is not replaced. Instead, a new “Significant” is added to the target<br></p>
