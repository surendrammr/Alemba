                                                    <p class="intro">A dependency diagram is a graphical display of all the tasks in a workflow which are required to complete a request. You can use it to create dependencies between tasks, that is, specify the order in which each will be completed, and which tasks need to be completed before others can be released. </p>
                                                    <p class="intro"> </p>
                                                    <p class="intro" style="text-align: center;">

                                                    </p>
                                                    <p class="note">There is no limit to the number of tasks and approvals that you can add to a workflow for completion of a request. However, your workflow may become difficult to read and understand if there are too many tasks displayed in the dependency diagram. It is therefore recommended to split your workflow into logical units to make it easy to use.</p>

                                                    <h2>Recursions on Dependency Diagrams</h2>
                                                    <p>It is possible for recursions to exist in your dependency diagram. Simply draw a dependency arrow back to a task or approval that occurred previously in the workflow. This characteristic is useful for when you wish to return to an earlier process in the workflow. For example, when developing software, if a bug has been discovered, you can direct the process to return to the development or testing sections of the workflow.</p>

<a name="Adding"></a>Adding Component Workflows</h2>
                                                    <p>Component workflows are workflow templates that can be inserted dynamically into larger workflow templates. These can be reused any number of times. A component workflow does not have a request start task. You can use workflow components if you have processes that need to be performed on a regular basis or to automate a process that is fairly generic and can be used organization-wide. </p>
                                                    <p class="note">Workflow components can be inserted into templates or into other components, but not directly in a request. The tasks in a component are automatically expanded in the request dependency diagram. </p>

                                                    <p class="note">When importing workflow templates with component workflows, you may need to identify which connector tasks are used with a workflow template. As each Connector task title is set to "Connector" by default, we recommend that you rename the title of the Connector task (that displays when you add a component workflow to the dependency diagram) with a unique name. This way you will be able to identify the appropriate Connector task when importing your workflow template.</p>
