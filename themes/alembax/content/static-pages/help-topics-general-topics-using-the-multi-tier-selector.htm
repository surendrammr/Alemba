                                                    <p>When a field has values organized in multiple tiers (that is, parent and child tiers), you can search for an item using the <b>Multi Tier Selector button</b> or by keying in some or all of the name of the value you are looking for. You can also navigate through the different tiers, either up or down, to make your selection.</p>
                                                    <p class="note">When this button is used for call types, it will consider partition settings, and 'Limit Type by IPK' settings.</p>
