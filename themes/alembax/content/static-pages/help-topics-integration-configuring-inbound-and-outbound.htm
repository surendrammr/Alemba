                                                    <p>The Integration Platform allows you to configure <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> to perform actions to exchange information between your <span class="GeneralVariablesSystemName">ASM System</span>, and a third party application or source for, say, communicating with a supplier’s service desk management system to assist in the resolution of an incident, or the completion of a workflow. The communication between <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> and the source about an action is enabled through messages. </p>
                                                    <p class="note">The integration of inbound and outbound actions shares similarities with Event Management but is not limited to the handling of event alerts. Furthermore, actions can be initiated both by <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> and the external application. </p>
