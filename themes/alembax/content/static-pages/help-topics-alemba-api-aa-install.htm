</h1>
                                                    <p>The <span class="GeneralVariablesAPIName">Alemba API</span> is installed by default. It does not require additional installation, licensing or cost to use.</p>
                                                    <p class="note">Installing the <span class="GeneralVariablesAPIName">Alemba API</span> will not impact your current API in any way. It is simply making it available for you to explore.</p>
                                                    <p>The web services should be automatically configured as part of the install. However, we advise that you:</p>
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li value="1">check the settings in IIS, to confirm that the App Pool is configured for automatic recycling out of working hours.</li>
                                                        <li value="2">configure SSL for both <span class="GeneralVariablesCompanyName2">Alemba®</span>.Web and <span class="GeneralVariablesCompanyName2">Alemba®</span>.API, to protect it from interception. To find out more about how to configure your SSL, see <a href="../authentication/configuring%20authentication.htm" class="MCXref xref">Configuring Authentication for the Alemba API</a>.</li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                    <p>The base url is <b>http://&lt;servername&gt;/&lt;VirtualDirectory&gt;/alemba.web</b>.</p>
                                                    <h2>Licensing and Permissions</h2>
                                                    <p>The <span class="GeneralVariablesAPIName">Alemba API</span> uses the same licensing structure as <span class="GeneralVariablesProductName">ASM</span>, and logging in as an analyst will consume a license.</p>
                                                    <p>You must have a valid login for <span class="GeneralVariablesProductName">ASM</span>, and the API will identify whether you are an analyst or a user. If you are held as both in your Person Details, you will be given the option to identify which type of session you require when you first log in to the explorer. See <a href="aa%20explorer%20log%20in.htm" class="MCXref xref">Logging In to the Alemba API Explorer</a> for more details.</p>
                                                    <p>You must have <b><span class="GeneralVariablesAPIName">Alemba API</span> Explorer</b> selected in the <a href="../admin%20security%20roles/general%20access%20security%20role%20-%20admin%20tab.htm" class="MCXref xref">General Access Security Roles – Admin Tab</a> of your <b>General Access</b> security role to access the explorer.</p>
                                                    <p class="tip">If you are using the API as a machine to machine service, it will use one of your licenses. You should consider whether you need to assign a named or concurrent license to that service.</p>
                                                    <h2>Authentication</h2>
                                                    <p>To find out more about setting up authentication for the <span class="GeneralVariablesAPIName">Alemba API</span>, see <a href="../authentication/authentication.htm" class="MCXref xref">Authentication</a>, <a href="../authentication/configuring%20authentication.htm" class="MCXref xref">Configuring Authentication for the Alemba API</a>, and <a href="../authentication/configuring%20windows%20authentication.htm" class="MCXref xref">Configuring Windows Authentication for the Alemba API</a>.</p>

                                                    <p>If you are upgrading from an earlier version of <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span>, run the <b>DatabaseChecker.exe</b> file, as described in the Upgrade guide, prior to running Resource Manager. This checks that your database has all the query tables necessary to run Resource Manager successfully.
