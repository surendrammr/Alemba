                                                    <p class="intro">The ability to manage IT software licenses or inventory items, from procurement to disposal is one of the foremost business requirements of IT departments. <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> Asset Management is a cohesive solution enabling IT departments to manage all lifecycle phases of software products and track inventory quantities, and also monitor the over or under utilization of software licenses.</p>
                                                    <p>Asset management also integrates with other areas of the application such as IPK and Workflow, enabling analysts to perform asset management transactions, such as order, purchase, allocate, reserve and retire, from calls, requests and tasks. The ability to manage licenses and inventory items through transactions is set through an analyst’s configuration security role. </p>

You can execute a transaction to order, purchase, allocate, reserve, transfer, and retire a quantity of licenses or inventory items.

These pools can be on order, on-hand (available), on-hand (unavailable), or in use. After executing a transaction, the item summary on the license or inventory details window is automatically recalculated, allowing you to see at a glance the number of items on order, reserved or in use.</p>
