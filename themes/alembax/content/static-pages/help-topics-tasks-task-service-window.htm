                                                    <h1>About the Service Window on a Task</h1>
                                                    <p>The Service Window is found in the lower half of the <b>Task Details</b> explorer pane. The Service Window displays agreements and active events for the current task. You can also view linked agreements through the <b>SLM</b> option on the Task Details Explorer. </p>
                                                    <p>Tasks can only have Organizational Level Agreements (OLAs) applied to them, therefore, you will only see OLA events within the Service Window on a task. External Supplier tasks can have Underpinning Contracts (UCs) applied to them, and therefore, you may see UC events for these tasks if applicable.</p>
                                                    <p class="note">If the request has an SLA applied, it may also show in the Service Window on the task, however, this is for display purposes only and you cannot stop or start the agreement clock on the SLA.</p>
                                                    <p>If there is no agreement applied to the task, the <b>Service Window</b> displays a message to this effect. If there is an agreement applied to the task, the active SLM events for the agreement appear within the <b>OLA</b> or <b>UC</b> section. Once an event (such as, Action) is complete, it disappears from the window. If the task is complete, the Resolve event remains in the window.  </p>
                                                    <h2>Viewing the name of the linked agreement</h2>
                                                    <p>Hover your cursor over the name of the agreement type displayed in the SLM bar (that is, OLA or UC).</p>
                                                    <h3>Showing and hiding events for the linked agreement</h3>
                                                    <p>Click the SLM bar. Both active and inactive events configured for the agreement appear. Once an event is closed, it no longer appears. </p>
                                                    <p>The <b>escalation states</b> for the linked agreement are color-coded to indicate the level of escalation or breach. Escalation states also appear in the <b>Search</b>, <b>Outstanding</b>, and <b>Workload</b> windows.</p>
                                                    <h3>Stopping and starting the clock on an agreement</h3>
                                                    <p>Once an agreement is attached to a task, it begins running against a ‘clock’. <span class="GeneralVariablesProductName">ASM</span> continually monitors the amount of time the agreement has been in effect and checks if any events are scheduled to occur. An agreement may trigger a number of events such as different types and levels of escalations, and breach. If you have sufficient permissions, you can stop and restart the clock on a particular agreement. This may be required, for instance, if you are waiting on further information from a customer and cannot proceed with the task until you get this information. While the clock is stopped, no time will accumulate on the agreement and no escalation or agreement breach events will occur. </p>

                                                        <li value="2">If the <b>Change Reasons</b> dialog box prompts you to specify the reasons for stopping the clock, do so by typing the reasons into the text area. This is so administrators can analyze clock stops to make sure there was sufficient reason for the clock on the agreement to be stopped. Click <b>OK</b>. This dialog box will be displayed only if your administrator has enabled <b>reasons</b> in system administration. </li>
                                                        <li value="3">When you stop the clock on an agreement, the list of events is replaced by a message “Clock Stopped”.</li>
