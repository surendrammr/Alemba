This section of the documentation deals with the RESTful <span class="GeneralVariablesAPIName">Alemba API</span>.

                                                    <p>It a RESTful API, and as such, is <b>entity</b> centric – it exposes all the entities within <span class="GeneralVariablesProductName">ASM</span>, and the verbs that can be used to manipulate those entities follow the same standard pattern. </p>
                                                    <h2>What is a RESTful API?</h2>
                                                    <p>A RESTful API is an Application Programming Interface that follows REST (or Representational State Transfer) principles to allow one system to manipulate data on another. REST is a widely used protocol that provides a wide range of benefits over older protocols, such as performance, scalability and simplicity.

                                                    <p>The <span class="GeneralVariablesAPIName">Alemba API</span> is self-documenting, in that you can discover more detail about how to use the API from the API itself.</p>
                                                    <p>The API fits within the <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> architecture, as described in <a href="aa%20architecture.htm" class="MCXref xref">Alemba API Architecture</a> and is installed automatically with the product. See <a href="aa%20install.htm" class="MCXref xref">Installing the Alemba API</a> for more details.</p>
                                                    <p>The <span class="GeneralVariablesAPIName">Alemba API</span> Explorer is the interface to the API. You are required to log in, as described in <a href="aa%20explorer%20log%20in.htm" class="MCXref xref">Logging In to the Alemba API Explorer</a>, and can then examine the entities with <span class="GeneralVariablesProductName">ASM</span>, as explained in <a href="alemba%20api%20explorer.htm" class="MCXref xref">Navigating the Alemba API Explorer</a>.</p>
                                                    <p>Once you are familiar with the explorer, you may wish to investigate the programmatic opportunities, in the <a href="aa%20programmers%20guide.htm" class="MCXref xref">Alemba API Programmers’ Guide</a>. The <a href="aa%20cookbook.htm" class="MCXref xref">Alemba API Programmers' Cookbook</a> contains information on how to use the API to create well-formed <span class="GeneralVariablesCompanyName2">Alemba®</span> objects; and the <a href="aa%20cookbook%20recipes.htm" class="MCXref xref">Alemba API Cookbook - Recipes</a> section contains further instruction and examples of programming in use. Finally, you may wish to be aware of the database tables that contain the metadata driving the API, which are listed in <a href="aa%20related%20db%20tables.htm" class="MCXref xref">Alemba API Related Database Tables</a>.</p>
