                                                    <p><span class="GeneralVariablesProductName">ASM</span> gives you the ability to ‘clone’ calls, that is, make a copy of the current call with all the existing details for it. A cloned call’s starting date/time is considered to be when the new call is cloned, not when its parent call was logged. This could be useful for routing a copy of a call to a different department so they can work on it simultaneously with another department. </p>

                                                        <concept term="IPK"></concept>If you are using the ITIL IPK tiers feature, instead of logging a new call afresh, you can use the <b>Clone</b> option to create another call based on the existing call. You can create a call of any type, such as Incident, Problem, Known Error or Service Request. This means that you can easily progress an existing call, for example from an Incident to a Problem, or a Problem to a Known Error, as you can set the IPK status of the new cloned call. When you clone an Incident to a Problem, the Problem is linked to the Incident as the Incident’s parent.</p>
                                                    <p>You can raise a request, for example, a Change, from a call using the <a href="%7B%7B%20'help-linking-explorer-option#top'%7CstaticPage%20%7D%7D#top">Linking</a> explorer option.</p>
                                                    <p>If you clone an Incident to a Problem, and later clone the same Incident to a Problem again, the system will display a message that the Incident is already linked, and that link will be broken if you proceed with creating the current link.</p>
                                                    <p>When you clone a call, you  choose from several options, depending on whether your system is using for the ITIL feature. </p>
