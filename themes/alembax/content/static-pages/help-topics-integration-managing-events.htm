<a name="top"></a>Managing Events</h1>
                                                    <p>In ITIL, an event is defined as a change of state which has significance for the management of a configuration item or IT service. It can also refer to an alert or notification created by any IT service, configuration item or monitoring tool.</p>
                                                    <p><span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> can easily handle events received from external systems such as network discovery tools and root cause analysis applications to provide an end-to-end Event Management solution.</p>
                                                    <p>Alerts generated by a network discovery tool monitoring the IT infrastructure, for example, can result in the automatic logging of a call within <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> and the appropriate routing of that call for resolution. The closure of that call within <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> can in turn update the status of the corresponding alert in the external application.</p>
                                                    <h2>
<a name="About"></a>About Event Transactions</h2>
                                                    <p>In reality, it is the connector – not the external system itself – that sends alerts and updates to <span class="GeneralVariablesProductName">ASM</span> after polling the external system. These alerts are called transactions. They can be of the following types:</p>
