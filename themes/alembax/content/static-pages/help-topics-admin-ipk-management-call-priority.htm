Priorities are used within the <a href="priority%20matrix.htm">Priority Matrix</a>. Escalation and agreement breach times can be calculated based on call priority (among other factors). By default, some sample priority names are already entered when your <span class="GeneralVariablesSystemName">ASM System</span> is installed. You can also define further priorities. </p>
