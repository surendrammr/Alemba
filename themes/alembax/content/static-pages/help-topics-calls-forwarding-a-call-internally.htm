When the analyst/group actions the call, it is no longer displayed in your <b>Calls Outstanding</b> window. Immediately after this call is sent, your Calls Outstanding window is refreshed to give you updated information on escalated calls and calls referred to you for your attention. Suspended calls can be viewed using the <b>Suspended Calls</b> filter on the <b>Calls Outstanding</b> window and the words "Call Suspended" in the title bar of the <b>Call Details</b> window. When the suspension time has passed, the call will return to the <b>Calls Outstanding</b> filter.</li>
                                                        <li value="8">If there are First Call Back or Response SLA events for an SLA applied to the call, these can be closed through the <a href="calls%20service%20window.htm">Service window</a>. If you are forwarding a new call that you have not yet saved, and wish to complete a first call back, you should go back to the main Call Details window, and save the call in order to allow the system to apply an SLA.</li>
