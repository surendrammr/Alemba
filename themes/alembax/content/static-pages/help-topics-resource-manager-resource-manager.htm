                                                    <p class="intro">The Resource Manager feature allows workflow group (team) managers to monitor their teams’ current commitments, and allocate tasks to individuals in a way that 
	makes the best use of analysts’ availability and skills, 
does not overload staff, and gets the work done more efficiently.
</p>
                                                    <p> </p>
                                                    <p>Resource Manager was introduced in 9.10 to give workflow group managers easy sight of what their team(s) and analysts are working on at any given time, at a task level. Within Resource Manager, you can see who is assigned which tasks, which tasks are unallocated, and allocate, reassign, and reschedule tasks within your team(s), based on availability and suitable skill sets.</p>
                                                    <p>Only certain tasks require resource management - those that need human involvement, such as standard tasks and approvals. As not all standard tasks and approvals require resource management, you can choose which of these tasks you wish to include in the Resource Manager function.</p>
                                                    <p>Within Resource Manager, analysts can be allocated more than one task for the same time period. Resource Manager will indicate graphically if analysts are over allocated; tasks are allocated to an analyst without the required skill (if this functionality is in use); tasks are out of sync; tasks are outside of the “task window”; and/or tasks overlap OLA/SLA breach time.</p>
                                                    <p>Some analysts may be assigned to several workflow groups, which may be managed by different team managers. In Resource Manager, you can see all of the tasks that have been allocated to your analysts, even if they have been allocated as a result of them being members of another workflow group.</p>
                                                    <p>Before you can use Resource Manager, certain settings and permissions are required, as described in <a href="rm%20set%20up.htm" class="MCXref xref">Preparing to Use Resource Manager</a>.</p>
                                                    <p>You can then access your resource managed tasks, as described in <a href="using%20resource%20manager.htm" class="MCXref xref">Using Resource Manager</a>.</p>
                                                    <p>You can allocate tasks, as described in <a href="rm%20allocating%20tasks.htm" class="MCXref xref">Allocating Tasks in Resource Manager</a>.</p>
                                                    <p>Analysts can then view the tasks they have been allocated in their Outstanding Workload window in <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span>, as described in <a href="../general%20topics/viewing%20your%20workload.htm" class="MCXref xref">Viewing the Workload </a>, or in <span class="GeneralVariablesProduct2Name">Nano</span>, as described in <a href="../nano/workload.htm" class="MCXref xref">Viewing Your Workload</a>.</p>
