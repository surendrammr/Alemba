                                            <p>The <span class="GeneralVariablesServiceRequestCatalog">Service Request Catalog</span> is a listing of all services that are available to you. The <span class="GeneralVariablesServiceRequestCatalog">Service Request Catalog</span> menu option provides a search facility that enables you to search for and view available services. You can search for services and log an Incident against a service or request a service. </p>
