                                            <p>Known Issues are documented when an Incident has been investigated and a solution or workaround has been implemented.  Known Issues represent an identified Problem that has occurred one or more times in the past and is expected to occur again. Known Issues are a component of the Knowledge Bank. </p>
                                            <p>You can search for Known Issues to find a resolution to your Problem before logging an Incident. </p>
