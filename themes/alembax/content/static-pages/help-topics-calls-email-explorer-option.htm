                                                    <p>The Email explorer option enables you to send an email to the user of the call, or an analyst or group. </p>
                                                    <p>Click the Email explorer option to display the Email window showing the details that will be sent. You can edit this information, if required. You can also format the email text, and add attachments. Email messages are saved as objects on the call. You can view the email messages sent by selecting the Object explorer option on the call. See the Sending an Email topic for more information on sending an email. </p>
                                                    <p>You can also send an email message to the user at call resolution or closure. </p>
                                                    <p>When an email is sent from a call, the MMA URL is populated based on the individual email addresses selected on the Email window, rather than to just the analyst or user associated with the call.</p>
                                                    <h3>Email Groups</h3>
                                                    <p><a name="aanchor12"></a>
                                                        <concept term="IPK"></concept>If you have specified an IPK or workflow group as one of the email recipients and this IPK or workflow group has an email address defined, the system sends an email using the group’s email address. Otherwise, if you send an email to an IPK or workflow group that does not have a group email address, the system sends the email to every analyst who is a member of that group using their individual email address.</p>
                                                    <h3>Call partitioning and email recipients</h3>
                                                    <p>When you send an email from a call you will be able to select analysts from all partitions as recipients, regardless of whether calls are partitioned on your <span class="GeneralVariablesSystemName">ASM System</span>. </p>
