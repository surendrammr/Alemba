                                                    <p class="intro">Security Roles are a way of restricting Analysts' access to different parts of <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span>. Instead of defining access permissions for each Analyst in the system, you simply create a security role, assign permissions to that role, and then assign the role to whoever needs these permissions.</p>
                                                    <p>Controlling access to different parts of the system is important. Often, large numbers of analysts need the same access permissions. For example, fifty members of staff working on the service desk all need the same permissions. It would be inefficient to set up specific permissions for each of them, so instead, you can create <b>security roles</b> for different areas of the system, each with their own set of permissions, and then simply assign security roles to each Analyst. Then every Analyst with the same security role will have the same access permissions.</p>
                                                    <p class="note">You can set security role permissions for users, using the options in the <a href="../adminselfserviceportal/cp%20roles.htm" class="MCXref xref">Self Service Portal Roles</a> group in the System Administration window.</p>
