The results will appear in a browse table located in the right hand window.  Each column of the Results browse table corresponds to a task attribute, such as Task No., Priority and Description.

To action the task, select <img src="/storage/app/media/Help/images/action%20button.png">. Depending on how your system is configured, double-clicking a task in the browse table either opens it in <b>Review</b> mode or in <b>Action</b> mode. To make any changes to the task, you must be in <b>Action</b> mode.</li>
                                                        <p class="note">

<p>If a task is currently open and is being updated by another analyst, you cannot take action until the locking analyst releases it either by deferring it, cancelling it, or forwarding it. If a task is completed, you will have to reopen the task and take action on it to make any changes. By doing so, you are effectively taking over responsibility for the request.</p>

This is effectively running a search within your original search. If viewing a Horizontal Bar graph, click the bar with the specific tasks that you wish to display (for example, all the tasks with a Priority 1). If viewing a Pie Chart, click the appropriate segment. A new Task Search window opens and displays all tasks specific to the selected bar or piece of the graph, in the form of a browse table.</li>
                                                        <li value="8">Once a graph is open, you can use the <img src="/storage/app/media/Help/images/options%20button.png"> button to customize the graph display.</li>
                                                        <li value="9">You can also use the <b>Copy Graph</b> button to copy the graph to your computer’s clipboard as a bitmap graphic. The graph can then be pasted into another program such as Microsoft Word.</li>
