                                                    <p>If you are sending an email from a call or request you can save, retrieve, update and delete drafts with attachments and recipients. When the draft email is sent, the original draft is deleted from the system. This is also true when a call is archived.</p>
                                                    <p>You can update and save the draft as many times as is needed before sending it, and you can attach as many email drafts as you wish to a call or request.</p>
                                                    <p>No action on the call or task is required in order to update an email draft. However, the call or request history records draft created, draft updated and draft deleted actions. Each of the history records contains information about the action performed, the person performing the action, the time the action was taken and the email subject. It should also be noted that cloning a call will not clone any linked draft emails.</p>
                                                    <p>A draft email can be viewed by any Analyst with access to the call or request. However, the fields in the draft email are generated based on the field security of the Analyst who created the draft. Furthermore, when an analyst has the email draft open, it is flagged as “locked” in the database and no other Analyst can open it.</p>
                                                    <p>If there are drafts associated with a call or request, the <b>Email</b> Explorer Option is orange and displays a small box beside it. This option returns to black once all drafts associated with the call or request are deleted or sent.</p>
