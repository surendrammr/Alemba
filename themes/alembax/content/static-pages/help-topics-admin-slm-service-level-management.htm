                                                    <p>Part of SLM is the definition of escalation and breach types, and creation of matrices to define when calls are escalated.</p>
                                                    <p>Escalation causes alarms to be activated when a call or request has not been actioned or closed within the required period of time. The call or request escalates to one or more analysts and appears on their Calls or Requests Outstanding window (providing the relevant escalation options have been selected).
</p>
                                                    <p>After a certain amount of time (longer than the escalation time), the service agreement is said to be “breached”. In this case, financial penalties may apply, depending on the particular agreements and relationships you have set up. Escalations are designed to prevent these agreement breaches by warning analysts that the maximum time permitted by the agreement is approaching.
</p>
                                                    <p>The periods of time in which you require calls to escalate are based upon <a href="agreement%20matrices.htm">matrices that you set up</a>. </p>

</p>
                                                    <p>Escalation recipients can also be defined for specific agreements. This is done on the <b class="Xref_outstanding">Agreement Details</b> window.</p>
