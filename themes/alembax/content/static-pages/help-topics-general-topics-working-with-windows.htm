</h1>
                                                    <p>You will probably find that you have several windows open in <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> at the same time. You can navigate your way around these windows in a number of ways. You can use the standard windows buttons in the top right hand corner of the screen  to maximise the display, show the active screen in a window, or minimize it. You can also use the menu and other options to switch between windows and arrange them as you wish on the screen.</p>
