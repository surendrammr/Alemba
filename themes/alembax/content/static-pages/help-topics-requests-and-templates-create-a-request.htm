                                                    <p>Analysts can create requests for any workflow process, provided they have access to both the workflow templates created for a process and the process itself.</p>
                                                    <p>Requests can only be created from workflow templates, and only for those processes that have templates defined.</p>
                                                    <p>Creating a request involves recording the details of the request for change that needs to be implemented. Once a request is created, you can forward it to another analyst, defer or complete it. </p>
