                                                    <p>Tasks must be created for each of the actions required to complete a request workflow. The request is considered completed when all the tasks within the request are completed. Tasks must be created from a request. <span class="GeneralVariablesProductName">ASM</span> provides a workflow task palette enabling you to create different types of tasks in <span class="GeneralVariablesProductName">ASM</span>.  </p>

                                                    <p class="answer">There is no limit on the number of tasks that you can add to a request. However, your workflow will become difficult to understand if you have too many tasks in it. Therefore, it is recommended that you split your workflow into logical units to make it easy to use.</p>
                                                    <p class="question">Can I add a component workflow to dependency diagrams?</p>
                                                    <p class="answer">Component workflows can be added to a dependency diagram only through workflow templates. You cannot directly add a component workflow to your dependency diagram through the request.</p>
                                                    <p class="question">How do I identify a component workflow in a dependency diagram?</p>
                                                    <p class="answer">When you create a request from a workflow template that includes a component workflow, the dependency diagram on the request displays a connector task that is linked to the tasks that constitute the component workflow. The Task Ref and Title for these tasks displays automatically in the dependency diagram from the component workflow.</p>
