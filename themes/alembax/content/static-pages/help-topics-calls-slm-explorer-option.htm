                                                    <p>The SLM explorer option allows you to view <a href="../slm/managing%20agreements.htm">Service Level Management agreements</a> currently in effect on a call. If an agreement is in effect against a call an orange indicator appears before the SLM option on the Call Details Explorer. </p>
                                                    <p>Additional SLM actions can be performed through the Service window, such as suspending or resuming an agreement (also referred to as stopping or starting the clock on the agreement) or closing events on all linked agreements when the service has resumed.</p>

                                                    <h2>Applying SLAs when a call is logged</h2>
                                                    <p>When a call is logged and then saved, deferred or forwarded, <span class="GeneralVariablesProductName">ASM</span> tries to find a matching agreement (SLA) where field values specified in call details match IPK Selection Criteria on any SLAs. When multiple SLAs are matched, <span class="GeneralVariablesProductName">ASM</span> will use the agreement with the matching IPK Selection Criterion that has the higher priority (defined in the Agreement Selection Priority in SLM administration). If no matches are found, <span class="GeneralVariablesProductName">ASM</span> checks for a default SLA and applies it, otherwise no SLA is applied.  </p>
                                                    <h2>Applying OLAs</h2>
                                                    <p>When a call is logged and then forwarded internally, <span class="GeneralVariablesProductName">ASM</span> tries to find a matching agreement (OLA) where the group selected on the Forward Internally window matches the group selected in the IPK Selection Criteria on any OLAs. If a match is found, the OLA is applied to the call, otherwise, no OLA is applied. </p>
                                                    <h2>Applying UCs</h2>
                                                    <p>The rules for forwarding externally and selecting UCs are more complex. UCs are only invoked if you forward a call externally to an analyst who is linked to the contract matching the UC Selection Criteria, that is, they are the point of contact for the external supplier. If the UC is linked to both an External Supplier and Contract through the Selection Criteria, then both the External Supplier and Contract selected on the Forward Externally window must match those linked to the UC. Otherwise, if the UC is only linked to either an External Supplier, or Contract, then, only one of these needs to match when forwarding the call externally. </p>
                                                    <h2>Applying SLAs when a call is updated</h2>
                                                    <p>If no SLA was initially linked to the call when it was logged, <span class="GeneralVariablesProductName">ASM</span> tries to find a matching agreement when the updated call is saved, deferred, or forwarded in the same way as if you applied the SLA when a call is logged. </p>
                                                    <p class="note">If an agreement is now applied, the target times for all events will be based on the original time the call was logged, not the time you update the call.</p>

If the same agreement still applies, then the existing agreement continues to be applied to the call. If no matches are found, <span class="GeneralVariablesProductName">ASM</span> checks for a default agreement and applies it, otherwise no SLA is applied and the original agreement is closed.</li>

According to its matrix, it will breach the agreement in one hour. Half an hour later, you change over to agreement B, which also has a time of 45 minutes until breach. However, changing the agreement has not “reset the clock”; you now only have 15 minutes before the agreement is breached, even though it has just come into effect on the agreement.</p>
