                                                    <p class="onlysql">This feature is only available on SQL systems.</p>
                                                    <p class="intro">This topic provides an introduction to how <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> can be configured for Single Sign-On (SSO) using Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) and the technical requirements to use this functionality.</p>
                                                    <p class="intro"> </p>
                                                    <p><span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> Analysts and Users will typically need access to a large number of internally and externally hosted (Cloud) applications each requiring usernames and passwords. Identity federation helps to solve this issue by providing a secure mechanism for sharing identities and therefore removing the need to maintain a separate user profile for <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span>.</p>
                                                    <p>SAML is an identity federation standard language that enables SSO without the need to remember passwords and is a convenient way to access web applications due to enhanced security. It limits potential risks by eliminating the need for extra web application passwords by establishing a trust between the <span class="GeneralVariablesAppName">ASM app</span> and the Organization's Federated Identity system(s).</p>

<span class="GeneralVariablesProductName">ASM</span> verifies this response. it tries to fiend an existing user. The criteria it uses depend on whether SSO is enabled within the Service Provider. If disabled, the application will always attempt to match the ‘NameID’ (set within the ADFS claim rules) with the ‘LoginID’ of the user. If the SSO resource has been enabled, resource mappings can be configured to match alternative fields instead of the default ‘LoginID’. See <a href="sso%20id%20provider%20import%20sp.htm" class="MCXref xref">Importing Service Provider metadata into the Identity Provider </a>for more details. It operates in the same way as normal integration; the first time a user is encountered the resource mapping matching tab is used and thereafter the external resource link is used.</li>

If not, and there is an existing account in AD and the SSO resource has been selected within the service provider, a new user is created using the resource mapping.
