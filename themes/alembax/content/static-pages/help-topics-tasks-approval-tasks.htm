                                                    <p> You may want to create approvals at various stages of the request and create dependencies such that certain tasks are not released until each approval is approved by the request manager. </p>
                                                    <p class="note">Analysts with <b>Approver</b> selected in the <a href="../admin%20security%20roles/workflow%20mgt%20sec%20role%20-%20tasks%20tab.htm">Tasks</a> tab of their <b>Workflow Management security role</b> can approve or reject Approval Tasks. If an analyst does not have approval rights, they will be able to view and take action on Approval Tasks but they will not be able to complete them.</p>
                                                    <p>Approval tasks are automatically scheduled to run when released in a request workflow. </p>
                                                    <p>If you want the user to complete the approval, you should create a user approval task.</p>
