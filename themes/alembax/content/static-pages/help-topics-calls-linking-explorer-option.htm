                                                    <p>Linking calls enables you to easily access related calls from the <b>Call Details</b> window, instead of having to search for each of them separately. You can link a call as a parent or a child of the current call. A call can be linked to only one parent call, but may be linked to several child calls. It is also possible to link a call to a call that has calls linked to it. In a typical ITIL environment, several Incidents are usually linked to a problem that is in turn linked to a known error.</p>
                                                    <p>You can also <a href="#">link requests to the current call</a> from the Linking window.</p>
                                                    <p>When linking the current call to a new request, you can select the Copy Details option to copy the details of the current call to the new call or request. Selecting this option will copy the description of the current call to the new call or request. Attached objects, forms, or attributes (if applicable) will not be copied to the new call or request.</p>
                                                    <p class="note">You could define the parent as a Major Incident or a Problem. This depends on the criteria identified for either type by the organization. You may also decide that you want to treat urgent issues as Major Incidents, and underlying issues that trigger them as Problems, which require addressing longer term.<br><br>You could also use AI Ops rules to automatically create a Major Incident/Problem based on a set of criteria being triggered.</p>
                                                    <p class="exampletext">The company’s mail server goes down. A call is logged to the service desk that “the mail server has gone down” (Call 100). The support analyst realizes that this event will inevitably lead to more calls. He knows that within a couple of hours, there will be more calls logged relating to this event, such calls as “I cannot send email” (Call 101) or “I cannot receive email” (Call 102). The analyst creates a Major Incident for call 100 by cloning it (MI 50), and links it as a parent so that when other calls are logged due to the same issue as provoked Call 100, they can be linked to MI 50. This then forms a Parent-Child hierarchy, whereby the parent call, the Major Incident, is the  cause, (the mail server has gone down), and Child calls are events that result from the Major Incident.<br></p>

<p>When you link calls of the same type, say two Incidents, the calls are grouped into one node and total number of calls appears. If you select the node, all the calls that make up the node are displayed in the table below. The nodes in the linking diagram display the abbreviation assigned to the IPK status of the linked calls. The colors assigned to a node are those that are assigned to the IPK status. However, the current call is always displayed in gray. This is to make it easy for you to identify the current call on which you are working.</p>

If three incidents are linked to the current call, the node will display 3 I.
