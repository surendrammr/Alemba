                                                    <p class="intro">External Supplier Tasks are tasks that need to be completed by external parties through the <span class="GeneralVariablesSelfServicePortalName">Self Service Portal</span>. An analyst can use an External Supplier Task to specify an external supplier (and contract, if necessary). The relevant external analyst will be notified when the task becomes active. The external analyst assigned the task is responsible for its completion.</p>
                                                    <p>Internal workflow process may involve having external parties perform certain activities, for example having an externally hosted server configured. These tasks can be added to the workflow as External Supplier Tasks.</p>
                                                    <p>External Contacts do not have access to <span class="GeneralVariablesProductName">ASM</span>, so their tasks are made visible through <span class="GeneralVariablesSelfServicePortalName">Self Service Portal</span>. </p>
                                                    <p>External Contacts can view their tasks, update them and mark them as complete (or incomplete) through <span class="GeneralVariablesSelfServicePortalName">Self Service Portal</span>. </p>
                                                    <p class="note">Each External Contact with a Login ID requires a named license to access the <span class="GeneralVariablesSelfServicePortalName">Self Service Portal</span>.</p>
                                                    <p>The benefits of using the External Supplier Task include:</p>
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li value="1">An internal analyst does not have to update the task on behalf of the supplier.</li>
                                                        <li value="2">There is a clear audit trial of what the supplier did and when.</li>
                                                        <li value="3">Escalations can be put in place for when the task starts or runs late.</li>
                                                        <li value="4">Instructions can be included within the task, removing the need to contact the supplier by email or phone to provide details.</li>
                                                        <li value="5">Task progress can be tracked by analysts without needing to contact the supplier.</li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                    <p>When an External Supplier Task is added to a workflow, an external supplier is linked to the task. A contract can also be linked to the task.</p>
                                                    <p>Once the task is activated (that is, preceding tasks have been completed), the supplier receives an email. This email provides information on what needs to be approved and includes a web address. The supplier can click on the web address in the email and be taken to the task through <span class="GeneralVariablesSelfServicePortalName">Self Service Portal</span> (they are required to login before they can see the task).</p>
                                                    <p>Suppliers can also locate their tasks by logging in to the portal and viewing their outstanding tasks.</p>
                                                    <p>Once the task is opened, the supplier can add information, defer the task or mark the task as complete or incomplete.</p>
