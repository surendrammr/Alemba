                                                    <h1>User Approval Tasks</h1>
                                                    <p>Workflow processes often require approvals to be given before a workflow can progress. Approvals are a critical stage in any workflow; they restrict approval permissions to certain individuals or groups and record details of the approval or rejection for auditing purposes. Once an approval task is completed, the workflow progresses down certain dependency paths, based on the approval or rejection decision.</p>
                                                    <p>Generally, approvals are completed within <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span>, with an analyst logging into the system, locating the approval and completing it. The User Approval Task provides a similar function with some key differences:</p>
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li value="1">A person flagged as a user must exist for the User Approval Task to be assigned.</li>
                                                        <li value="2">Users can approve or reject these tasks using the <span class="GeneralVariablesSelfServicePortalName">Self Service Portal</span>; however, they cannot forward User Approval Tasks internally or externally. </li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                    <p>The benefits of using the User Approval Task include:</p>
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li value="1">The approver does not need to know how to navigate the full <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> interface. Learning how to use <span class="GeneralVariablesSelfServicePortalName">Self Service Portal</span> requires less training than the full application.</li>
                                                        <li value="2">The approver does not need an analyst license; this means an unlimited number of users can be approvers through <span class="GeneralVariablesSelfServicePortalName">Self Service Portal</span>.</li>
                                                        <li value="3">A person can set up as both an analyst and a user through their person details record, allowing analysts to complete User Approvals through <span class="GeneralVariablesSelfServicePortalName">Self Service Portal</span>. This configuration can free up shared licenses for occasional users.</li>
                                                        <li value="4">User Approval Tasks can also be approved in the main application by full analysts with <b>Approver</b> rights on the <a href="../admin%20security%20roles/workflow%20mgt%20sec%20role%20-%20tasks%20tab.htm">Tasks</a> tab of their <b>Workflow Management security role</b>. This may be necessary when a user is unavailable to handle an approval that has been assigned to them.</li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                    <p>When a User Approval task is added to a workflow, a user must be linked to the task. Request managers can assign one or more users to the User Approval task when adding the task to a workflow template or request (if the approval has not yet become active). If multiple users are added, then when the task is activated, a separate User Approval task is created for each one. </p>
