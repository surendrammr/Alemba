                                                    <p> The licenses in the default pool are used if they are available. When they are all in use, Analysts with access to the corralled licenses can still log in and will be assigned one of the corralled licenses. Corralled licenses do not restrict Analysts named in that corral when there are other licenses still available. They are only reserved when the remaining general licenses have been used.</p>
                                                    <p>Say, for example, you are running a service desk that must have at least five Analysts logged in at all times. To ensure that there are always five logins available, you could corral five licenses for the Service Desk. This would mean that if all of the default licenses are used, five Analysts in the Service Desk corral can still log in.</p>

                                                    <p>All licenses are allocated to a single "default" corral when <span class="GeneralVariablesCoreName">ASM Core</span> is first installed. You can create new corrals, and allocate licenses to them. You can even associate session timeouts for particular license corrals so that an Analyst can remain logged in under the license only for the specified time limit.
