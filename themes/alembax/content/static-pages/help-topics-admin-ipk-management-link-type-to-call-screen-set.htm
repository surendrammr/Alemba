                                                    <p class="intro">You can link issue types to call screen sets, so that specific <span style="font-weight: bold;">Call Details</span> windows are displayed when an Analyst selects an issue type when logging a call.</p>
                                                    <p>You can create and link multiple call screens for logging calls. When an Analyst selects a type on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Call Details</span> window, the window will refresh and use the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Details</span> window belonging to the screen set linked to that type. This is useful if different issue types require different information to be recorded when a call is logged. </p>
