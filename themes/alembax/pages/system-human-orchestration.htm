            <p class="lead">Everyone is aware of the benefits that <a href="{{ 'business-process-management'|page }}">automating business processes</a> can bring. However, typically an organization will have software and solutions around task management for instructing their teams what jobs they should do next.  Completely separately there are likely to be data architects designing interfaces and data bases between one piece of software and the next.</p>
            <p>Alemba Service Manager brings both of these disciplines together in a single workflow. Here’s how it works:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Send a job to a human.</li>
                <li>When it has been completed, automatically and seamlessly pass the next job to a system.</li>
                <li>Once the third-party software has done its processing it can send a result back into the same workflow and again instruct the next person.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>This unrivalled power allows you to make your business processes 100% automated. Put the Digital Twin of the Organization (DTO) modelling straight to use.</p>
