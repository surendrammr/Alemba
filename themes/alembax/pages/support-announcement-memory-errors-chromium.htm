            <p class="lead">We have received increased reports from Customers of the browser tab crashing when Analysts are performing actions in Alemba Service Manager Core Interface.</p>
            
            <p>Following our initial investigations, we believe this is being caused by a recent change to the underlying Chromium Browser Engine that is used by Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. <br><br>
                A change was introduced in version v104 and is present in v105 to restrict the amount of memory the browser tabs use on the Analysts Client Device.<br><br>
                Details of the change can be found in the <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1352649">Chromium Bug Report</a>.<br><br>
                We are awaiting the M106 Stable Release of Chromium Browsers where this issue should now be resolved. The current release date for this is the 27th September 2022. <br><br>
                We will continue to monitor this situation with this Browser release.</p>
