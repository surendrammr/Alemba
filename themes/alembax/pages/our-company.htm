			<p class="lead">Alemba was founded in 2007 with the goal of providing high-quality services in the IT Service Management market. Initially, we focused on the support of infra Enterprise and VMware Service Manager.</p>

			<p>We soon saw that many customers struggled to achieve process maturity, hampered by legacy tools that were too difficult and clumsy to use. Alemba began developing Alemba Service Manager, a unique Enterprise Service Management solution that combines depth of functionality and ease-of-use to enable customers to achieve more for much less cost and effort.<br /><br />

			On 1 July 2014, Alemba assumed ownership of the VMware Service Manager product and now has full control of its future development, license provision, and global services and support.<br /><br />

			Today, Alemba delivers specialist Enterprise Service Management solutions to a rapidly-growing global customer base across a wide range of sectors, including Education, Health Care, Finance, Non-profit, and Government. With offices in the United Kingdom, Europe, Australia and the United States, we have grown exponentially over the past 8 years.</p>

			<p>Our mission, however, remains the same:</p>

			<p class="lead blue">To create the next generation of Enterprise Service Management software, putting user experience at the heart of everything we do.</p>
